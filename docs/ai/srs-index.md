# SRS navigation index

Index into `docs/Melbourne_Sphere_Technical_SRS_v1.md` (889 lines, MD5 `c444e13d22d55e83a63f152714a354c1` on 2026-09-08; SRS revision 1.7). It maps implementation areas to the SRS's own headings and requirement IDs so a session reads the complete relevant sections instead of the whole document. It is not a specification: when in doubt, open the section. Line numbers are approximate anchors for `sed -n`; headings are exact.

Per-phase acceptance criteria are written in `docs/setup-progress.md` from these sections; the requirement-level status lives in `docs/requirements-traceability.md`.

Sections 25–26 were added at revision 1.2 and extend the earlier sections; the obligations of sections 10, 16, 17, 18 and 19 apply to every module specified there. The Logimart reference comparison that informed them is `docs/reference/logimart-comparison.md` — a behavioural reference only, never an architecture or security reference.
