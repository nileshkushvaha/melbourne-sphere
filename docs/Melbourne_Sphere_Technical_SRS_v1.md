Melbourne Sphere Technical SRS

Software requirements specification

Version 1.5 • 8 September 2026 • MVP baseline with the administrator access-control extension (section 10), the operational administration and website content modules (sections 25–26), the public directory route rename (UX 002/003), the settings storage correction (SET 001) and the showcase publication change (TSTM 002, PTNR 003)

Melbourne Sphere is a Melbourne only business directory and editorial blog. Visitors discover businesses, read local articles, submit moderated reviews and comments, and send enquiries without creating accounts. Administrators control all listings, publishing, moderation and website settings.

This document defines the implementation contract for the product, engineering, design, testing and operations teams. It consolidates the agreed architecture and scope into numbered requirements, data rules, service boundaries and verifiable release criteria. It authorizes planning only; application implementation is a separate activity.

## Document control

Document ID: MS SRS 001. Business owner: Melbourne Sphere client. Technical owner: delivery technical lead. Prepared for client and delivery team. Reviewers: product owner, engineering lead, QA lead and operations owner. Individual names and approval dates are to be recorded at baseline acceptance.

Authority: the latest approved revision of this SRS governs implementation and future audits. Explicit client decisions override earlier planning suggestions. Sections marked Future are excluded from MVP. Proposed operating thresholds are baseline engineering targets, not claims about a running service or existing client service agreement.

Change rule: record the requirement IDs affected, reason, data and security impact, migration and test impact, approver and effective version. Do not silently change scope through tickets, UI mockups or implementation details. Retain superseded revisions and link release evidence to the exact SRS version.

| **Revision** | **Date**   | **Change**                                                        | **Approval state**                       |
| ------------ | ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| 1.0          | 5 Sep 2026 | Consolidated Melbourne only scope and complete technical baseline | Prepared for client and technical review |
| 1.1          | 7 Sep 2026 | Administrator access control extended at explicit client instruction: roles carry permissions, roles are assigned to administrators, permissions may also be granted directly to an administrator, and the admin interface shows only what the signed-in administrator may use. Adds RBAC 002–RBAC 012 and amends RBAC 001 and ADM 003. Requirement IDs affected: RBAC 001, ADM 003 (amended), RBAC 002–012 (new). Reason: client requirement for staff roles and per-administrator access. Data impact: new direct-permission, role and permission-catalogue columns and one authorization audit table, delivered by reviewed migrations; no existing requirement withdrawn. Security impact: authorization becomes an explicit backend module with default deny, cache invalidation and audit; hiding interface elements remains insufficient. Test impact: effective-permission, enforcement, invariant, cache and interface suites in section 21. Approver: client instruction of 7 Sep 2026, recorded by the delivery technical lead. | Approved by client instruction; pending countersignature at baseline acceptance |
| 1.2          | 7 Sep 2026 | Operational administration, security settings and website content modules added at explicit client instruction: shared settings architecture, the Resend transactional email provider with delivery records and provider webhooks, a consolidated activity log, security settings (authentication, password policy, login security, session security), a cache manager, a queue monitor, scheduled tasks, frequently asked questions, service alerts, testimonials and client/partner logos. Requirement IDs affected: SET 001–005, MAIL 001–010, ACT 001–006, SECS 001–008, CMGR 001–005, QMON 001–005, TASK 001–006, RBAC 013, FAQ 001–005, ALRT 001–007, TSTM 001–005, PTNR 001–005 (new, sections 25–26); ADM 002, PRIV 001 retention table, QA 001 test matrix (T16–T17), the section 14 entity table, the section 16 admin API table, the launch decision register (D09–D10) and FUT 003 (amended). Reason: client requirement for operator tooling, explicit security configuration and additional public content. Data impact: new tables for delivery records, activity events, scheduled task history, frequently asked questions, service alerts, testimonials and partner records, plus typed settings storage per owned group, delivered by reviewed migrations; no existing requirement withdrawn and no existing table restructured. Security impact: credentials remain environment-managed and are never stored in settings or returned by any endpoint; the provider webhook is signature-verified and idempotent; cache, queue and scheduler surfaces are restricted to registered operations with no command execution, no raw key access and no arbitrary payloads; security settings are bounded by AUTH 001/002 and SEC 002 and may never remove the last recovery path. Test impact: new verification groups T16 (operational administration) and T17 (website content modules) in section 21. Approver: client instruction of 7 Sep 2026, recorded by the delivery technical lead. | Approved by client instruction; pending countersignature at baseline acceptance |
| 1.3          | 7 Sep 2026 | Public directory routes renamed at explicit client instruction so the list, the curated pages and the listing itself share one prefix: `/directory` becomes `/business`, `/directory/category/{slug}` becomes `/business/category/{slug}` and `/directory/area/{slug}` becomes `/business/area/{slug}`; `/business/{slug}` is unchanged. Public navigation and breadcrumbs read "Businesses". Requirement IDs affected: UX 002, UX 003 route contract (amended); SEO 002/004 and DIR 006 apply unchanged to the new addresses. Reason: client requirement for a consistent public URL prefix. Data impact: none — no table, column or slug changes. The old addresses answer 301 to their mechanical equivalent in the web middleware rather than through the redirect table, because a route rename must not depend on seeded data; the sitemap emits only the new addresses. Security impact: none. `category` and `area` become reserved business slugs, because a static route segment wins over the dynamic one and a listing slugged that way would otherwise be unreachable. Test impact: web, SEO sitemap and Playwright journeys updated to the new addresses, plus a reserved-slug unit test and a redirect check. Approver: client instruction of 7 Sep 2026, recorded by the delivery technical lead. | Approved by client instruction; pending countersignature at baseline acceptance |
| 1.4          | 7 Sep 2026 | SET 001 corrected at client instruction. The requirement continues to separate configuration by ownership — one owning module, one permission pair, one validation path and one declared cache consequence per group — but no longer requires a separate table per group: four tables with identical columns added migrations and joins without adding any guarantee the code-declared registry does not already enforce. Storage is one `settings` table keyed by (group, key); a group and key the registry does not declare cannot be read or written, so it is typed by code rather than an untyped dumping ground, and SET 004 (no secret is ever a setting) is unchanged. Requirement IDs affected: SET 001 (amended). Data impact: migration `20260907203000_settings_single_table` creates the table, copies the two existing `site_settings` documents into it under the `website` group with versions, actors and timestamps intact, and drops `site_settings` plus the three empty per-group tables created the same day. The same correction removed a duplicated persistence path: the website group's home and general settings now use the shared store rather than their own copies of the version check, transaction, audit write and cache purge. Security impact: none. Test impact: registry and store specs updated; the settings-group and site-settings integration suites pass unchanged in behaviour. Approver: client instruction of 7 Sep 2026, recorded by the delivery technical lead. | Approved by client instruction; pending countersignature at baseline acceptance |
| 1.5          | 8 Sep 2026 | Publication of testimonials and client/partner logos no longer requires a recorded approval or authorisation, at client instruction: both are entered by administrators, who take the publication decision themselves. Requirement IDs affected: TSTM 002, PTNR 003 (amended). The approval and authorisation records remain, optional, as the only evidence that consent or permission was obtained; recording one still names the administrator and the time, editing a quote or replacing a logo still clears the record it covered, and both remain permission-separated from creating and publishing. PTNR 003 keeps two publication requirements, because they are about the page rather than about permission: a logo asset and its alternative text, without which the logo strip is broken and unreadable for every visitor (MED 003, NFR 006). Data impact: none — no column added or removed; the gates were application logic. Security impact: none. The residual risk is legal rather than technical and is recorded here: publishing a quote or a mark without the subject's permission is an exposure the system no longer prevents, and the optional note is what evidences it was obtained. Test impact: showcase integration and admin screen tests updated to the new rule. Approver: client instruction of 8 Sep 2026, recorded by the delivery technical lead. | Approved by client instruction; pending countersignature at baseline acceptance |
| 1.6          | 8 Sep 2026 | Public information pages restructured at explicit client instruction, and the About page specified. The editable page set becomes About, Privacy Policy, Terms of Use and Review Guidelines; the editable Contact page is withdrawn, because `/contact` is a product route whose routing address already comes from the general settings of CFG 001 — an editor could otherwise redirect enquiries by typing an address into page copy, and two sources for one address is one too many. About keeps the same content record — title, body, SEO fields, revisions, publication state — but is rendered by a bespoke public template and edited on its own screen; the remaining three share the generic reading template. In the admin the master-detail "Information pages" screen is replaced by Website → Pages: a list of the known pages, each opened on its own route. Requirement IDs affected: CFG 002 (amended), SEO 002 (amended: a `pages` sitemap section), UX 002/003 route contract (unchanged addresses, changed content source for `/contact`); new ABT 001–006. Data impact: no schema change. The `static_pages.contact_email` column is retained but no longer written or served, pending a reviewed drop; rows for a withdrawn slug are ignored by the registry rather than deleted, so no content is destroyed. Security impact: positive — one fewer editable path to a contact address, and the fixed slug set is unchanged. Content: the About page ships with baseline copy that describes how the product actually works, written into an empty row by an idempotent seed that never overwrites an editor's changes; the client's approved wording replaces it through the editor. Test impact: static pages, SEO sitemap and admin page tests updated; About page, navigation and metrics tests added. Approver: client instruction of 8 Sep 2026, recorded by the delivery technical lead. | Approved by client instruction; pending countersignature at baseline acceptance |
| 1.7          | 8 Sep 2026 | Administrators may create their own information pages, at explicit client instruction. Until now the slug set was closed, which is what guaranteed nobody could publish an arbitrary top-level URL; that guarantee is now kept by validation rather than by a fixed list — a strict lower-case pattern, a reserved list covering every public route and the framework and admin paths, and a uniqueness check — so an editor can add a page without being able to shadow a product route or take an address the framework already serves. The four system pages (About, Privacy Policy, Terms of Use, Review Guidelines) remain declared in code and cannot be created, renamed or deleted, because the product links to them by address. A created page carries the same content rules as any other: sanitised rich text, revisions of published text, and the publication gate that refuses stub or placeholder copy. Its address is fixed at creation, because anything linking to a page links to its address; a change means a new page and a redirect. Deletion is refused for a system page and for a page still published — unpublishing first makes the resulting 404 a decision rather than a discovery — and takes the page's revisions with it. Requirement IDs affected: CFG 002 (amended), SEO 002 (the `pages` sitemap section now lists every published page). Data impact: none — a custom page is a `static_pages` row whose slug the registry does not name, so no column or migration was needed. Security impact: the closed set is replaced by validation that is tested directly, including path-traversal and route-shadowing attempts; publication, sanitisation and permissions are unchanged, and creating or deleting a page needs `settings.manage` like every other page action. Test impact: slug-validation unit tests, five integration cases (create, reserved and taken addresses, malformed addresses, the two deletion refusals, delete and stop serving), and admin and web tests for the create form, the delete affordance and a created page rendering. Approver: client instruction of 8 Sep 2026, recorded by the delivery technical lead. | Approved by client instruction; pending countersignature at baseline acceptance |

## Reading guide

Sections 1–3 establish scope, reference interpretation and architecture. Sections 4–12 specify public and admin behavior. Sections 13–17 define data, APIs, events and security. Sections 18–22 cover quality, operations, verification and delivery. Sections 23–24 record decisions and source references. Sections 25–26, added at revision 1.2, specify the operational administration modules and the website content modules; they extend the earlier sections rather than replacing them, and existing section numbers are unchanged so that requirement references remain stable.

# 1 Scope and requirement governance

## Mandatory scope

**SCP 001 —** The MVP shall serve Melbourne, Victoria, Australia only. City, country and timezone are server owned constants: Melbourne, AU and Australia/Melbourne. There shall be no city selector, country selector, city CRUD, multi tenant routing, geographic tenancy key or city hierarchy. Local areas are subdivisions within the approved Melbourne boundary, not additional cities.

**SCP 002 —** Only administrator accounts shall exist. Businesses request additions or corrections by email; external authors submit content by email. No public registration, ownership claim, business dashboard, reviewer profile, self service listing submission or public publishing endpoint shall be exposed.

**SCP 003 —** MVP includes directory browsing, categories, Melbourne local areas, keyword/service search, business details, ratings and reviews, enquiries, blog categories/tags/authors, comments, reporting, moderation, media, SEO, static information pages and secure administration. Manual featured placement is included; paid promotion and billing are future scope.

## Interpretation and precedence

Every numbered requirement is mandatory unless explicitly labelled conditional or future. "Shall" is testable behavior. Engineering defaults may be changed only through the change rule. The user's Melbourne only instruction supersedes the prior plan's generic location hierarchy and suburb examples; those examples do not authorize additional territory.

**SCP 004 —** Listing eligibility shall be checked against a client approved boundary and local area allowlist. Until that decision is recorded, use the City of Melbourne council area as the conservative planning boundary, not all Greater Melbourne. The exact geography is a pre launch content gate. No listing shall be published merely because its postcode or free text address contains "Melbourne". Service area businesses must operate within the approved boundary and meet the same editorial verification rule.

## Actors and responsibility

| **Actor**               | **Permitted activity**                                    | **Accountability**                                  |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Visitor                 | Browse and submit forms without login                     | Follow published content guidelines                 |
| Super Admin             | Manage all content, moderation and settings               | Verify accuracy, rights and publication decisions   |
| Technical operator      | Deploy, restore and monitor through infrastructure access | Least privilege access and incident handling        |
| Business or contributor | Request changes or submit content by email                | Provide accurate information and publication rights |

**SCP 005 —** Product approval shall record final boundary, brand assets, contact recipient, content policy and vendor choices in section 23. A missing decision must not be replaced by fabricated production information. Core architecture and MVP functions remain the baseline while these launch configuration decisions are resolved.

Acceptance: QA shall verify no public account journey or city switching exists and shall reject an out of boundary listing through both the admin UI and a direct API request.

# 2 Reference and public experience

## Reference interpretation

The supplied hero reference shows a wide city photograph, dark blue overlay, large centered heading, counters and a rounded horizontal search bar with a location segment, a discovery segment and a prominent search icon. The requested rotating or scrolling headline is a behavior requirement supplied by the client; timing cannot be inferred from a still image.

The Boca Locals screenshots establish directory cards, galleries, services, opening hours, contact actions, review forms, blog cards/articles and About and Contact pages. The live homepage also demonstrates category discovery and recent articles \[R2\]. These are functional references, not assets to copy.

**UX 001 —** Use original Melbourne branding, licensed Melbourne photography and original copy. Sky blue and navy are primary colors, with balanced light and dark surfaces, restrained gradients and subtle glass treatments. Background opacity and blur shall never compromise contrast or content performance. Ant Design remains the admin component foundation; public styling uses Tailwind and shadcn/ui.

**UX 002 —** Public navigation shall include Home, Businesses, Blog, About and Contact, plus an email based "Add or update a business" action. Footer links shall include Privacy, Terms and Review guidelines. Navigation, breadcrumbs and content headings shall remain usable by keyboard and screen reader.

## Public route contract

| **Route**                                          | **Purpose**                   | **Index policy**               |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| /                                                  | Hero and discovery home       | Index                          |
| /business                                          | All published businesses      | Index                          |
| /business/category/{slug}                          | Curated category landing      | Index if substantive           |
| /business/area/{slug}                              | Approved Melbourne local area | Index if substantive           |
| /business/{slug}                                   | Stable business detail        | Index when published           |
| /directory and /directory/…                        | Renamed in 1.3; 301 to the /business equivalent | Not indexed        |
| /blog and /blog/{slug}                             | Blog index and article        | Index when published           |
| /blog/category/{slug} and /blog/tag/{slug}         | Editorial collections         | Index only curated collections |
| /about /contact /privacy /terms /review-guidelines /{page} | Information and policies, plus any page an administrator has created at a validated address (CFG 002, 1.7); /about has its own template (ABT 001–006) and /contact is a product route rather than editable content | Index by default; an unpublished or non-existent address answers 404 and is not indexed |
| /business?q=… and filtered combinations            | Dynamic search results        | Noindex follow                 |
| /admin and admin subroutes                         | Restricted application        | Noindex and authentication     |

**UX 003 —** No generic city route shall be introduced. Category plus area combinations use query parameters in MVP, not mass generated location pages. A short stable business slug shall not contain its category. Persisted slugs change only by explicit admin action with redirects.

Acceptance: navigation shall reach a business and an article within three deliberate interactions from the homepage; deep links, refresh and back navigation shall preserve results state.

# 3 Agreed architecture and repository

**ARC 001 —** Implement a pnpm workspace monorepo with TypeScript throughout. Pin compatible supported versions in the lockfile and record them in the architecture decision register before development; the SRS does not assume that "latest" packages are mutually compatible.

| **Boundary**            | **Technology**                            | **Responsibility**                                                |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| apps/web                | Next.js and React                         | Server rendered public pages, metadata, accessible interactions   |
| apps/admin              | React, Refine and Ant Design              | Admin forms, tables, previews and moderation workflows            |
| apps/api                | NestJS                                    | REST /api/v1, validation, authorization and domain transactions   |
| apps/worker             | Nest compatible worker runtime and BullMQ | Email, media, publishing, invalidation and maintenance jobs       |
| packages/database       | Prisma and MySQL                          | Schema, versioned migrations and database access for backend only |
| packages/contracts      | OpenAPI generated TypeScript contracts    | Public and admin clients without persistence models               |
| packages/config         | Shared lint and TypeScript configuration  | Consistent build and quality rules                                |
| packages/ui             | Public Tailwind and shadcn components     | Public design system without admin bundle coupling                |
| infrastructure and docs | Deployment definitions and runbooks       | Environments, operations and decision records                     |

**ARC 002 —** Next.js shall obtain domain data through NestJS. Browser applications shall never access MySQL, Redis or storage credentials. Only API and worker services own Prisma access. Share domain services where a worker needs the same invariant; do not copy publication or moderation rules into clients.

**ARC 003 —** Use MySQL with utf8mb4, Redis for distributed limits/cache and BullMQ, S3 compatible object storage with CDN for approved media, and an email provider adapter. Deploy public web, admin assets, API and worker as independently operable components. Start as a modular monolith, not microservices.

**ARC 004 —** Route browser traffic through one HTTPS origin: / for Next.js, /admin for the admin application, /api/v1 for NestJS. Infrastructure shall preserve client IP only from trusted proxies. The production hostname is configured, not assumed to be owned. Use private networking for database, Redis and worker connections.

**ARC 005 —** Refine is the agreed admin framework. Its data provider shall translate pagination, filters, sorting, errors and custom actions to the REST contract \[R3\]. It does not replace NestJS authorization or generate the complete backend. A vertical slice shall validate nested listing fields, image upload, publishing, permission denial and stale edit handling before broad CRUD development.

Acceptance: apps build independently from one lockfile; browser bundles contain no backend secrets or Prisma client; a vertical slice exercises real API permissions and migrations.

# 4 Hero banner and search interaction

**HERO 001 —** The homepage shall render a full width Melbourne background image with configurable desktop/mobile focal point and a navy overlay. The image shall have defined dimensions, responsive sizes and a prioritized optimized hero rendition. Provide a solid color fallback; do not use autoplay video, unlicensed reference photography or parallax in MVP.

**HERO 002 —** Provide one semantic H1 with a stable accessible meaning such as "Discover Melbourne businesses". A visible phrase may rotate vertically through 2–5 admin managed phrases, for example local services, places to eat and independent shops. Initial text shall be present in server HTML. Rotation defaults to a 4 second dwell and 300 millisecond transition with reserved height, so layout does not shift.

**HERO 003 —** A persistent keyboard accessible pause/resume control shall accompany automatically continuing animation. Respect prefers-reduced-motion by rendering a static first phrase with no motion. Pause while the page is hidden. Do not announce every phrase through a live region; screen readers receive one coherent stable headline. Auto motion controls follow WCAG pause requirements \[R4\].

**HERO 004 —** The rounded search panel shall contain a visibly fixed "Melbourne, Australia" label, a labelled keyword input, a category/service discovery control and a clearly named Search button. The location label is text, not an editable or disabled required field. Do not trust a client supplied city parameter. On mobile, stack controls with a full width action; preserve labels rather than relying only on placeholders.

**HERO 005 —** A single keyword field accepts business names, categories and services. Category selection is optional and constrains results; services are matched via indexed service labels and synonyms. Suggestions shall group categories/services/businesses and support arrows, Enter and Escape. Debounce by about 250 milliseconds, require two characters for suggestions, cap at eight suggestions and ignore stale responses. Search still works when suggestions fail.

**HERO 006 —** Submit via GET to /business (renamed from /directory in revision 1.3) with q and optional category slug. Empty submission opens all listings. Enter and the button behave identically. Search shall be usable without client JavaScript using a server rendered form; enhanced suggestions are progressive. Never auto navigate merely because a suggestion becomes focused.

**HERO 007 —** Do not reproduce the reference's cities counter. Optional category/business counters, if enabled by an admin, shall use published records only and carry accurate labels. Hide counters when their data is unavailable rather than display invented totals.

Acceptance: test at 320, 375, 768, 1024 and 1440 CSS pixels, 200 percent zoom, keyboard only, reduced motion and slow image loading. The form shall remain usable, contrast shall pass and hero movement shall cause no observable layout shift.

# 5 Directory search and discovery

**DIR 001 —** Directory, category and local area pages shall expose published eligible businesses only. Cards include image or fallback, name, primary category, local area, review average/count when available and detail/contact actions. Zero reviews display "No reviews yet", not zero stars. Featured placements carry an explicit "Featured" label.

**DIR 002 —** The API shall combine keyword, category, approved local area and minimum approved rating filters using AND. Category matches include its active descendant categories. Keyword matches name, category labels, services and curated keywords; it shall never search private emails, moderation notes or enquiry content. Filter counts shall be calculated from the same publication scope.

**DIR 003 —** Normalize whitespace and case; q length is 0–120 characters. Use indexed MySQL search through a SearchService abstraction. Name exact/prefix match outranks category/service match, which outranks description match. Short terms and MySQL stop words require a bounded indexed name/service prefix fallback; do not depend exclusively on FULLTEXT defaults. Typos and semantic search are future scope.

**DIR 004 —** Sort choices are relevance, highest rated, newest and name A–Z. Relevance defaults for nonempty q; name A–Z defaults otherwise. Highest rated sorts average descending, approved review count descending, then stable ID. Newest uses firstPublishedAt descending then stable ID. Unrated businesses follow rated businesses for rating sort. Document SQL collation and deterministic tie rules.

**DIR 005 —** Use page numbered pagination, default 20, maximum 50 per request and a bounded maximum accessible result window of 10,000. Return total and pageCount. Reset page to one when filters change. Invalid enum/range inputs return a field error; an unknown valid slug returns an empty result. Pages beyond the result count display an empty state with a link to page one.

**DIR 006 —** Persist q, category, area, minRating, sort and page in the URL. Provide removable filter chips, reset, result count, loading, retry and no result states. Empty results suggest broadening the query or removing filters; do not silently expand geography. A failed backend request shall not be reported as zero matching businesses.

**DIR 007 —** Featured businesses occupy a separate labelled block with at most three eligible matching entries. For a given query, select this set deterministically and exclude those IDs before calculating organic counts and pagination. Keep the same featured set across result pages; reset on filter changes. Featured status shall not bypass matching, geography or publication rules. Paid/sponsored ordering is not part of MVP.

**DIR 008 —** "Open now" filtering is conditional and disabled until complete hours data and daylight saving tests pass. The rest of search shall ship without this filter if data quality is insufficient. Distance sorting, user geolocation and interactive map search are future features.

Acceptance: seed exact, partial, short and no match queries, tied ratings, inactive categories and unpublished records; verify deterministic results, filter combinations and absence of private fields.

# 6 Business listings and local areas

**BUS 001 —** A business detail page shall show name, description, primary and secondary categories, service labels, gallery, approved public address or service area, phone, website, social links, operating hours, contact actions, review summary, approved reviews and related listings. Optional missing fields shall be omitted cleanly, without fabricated values.

**BUS 002 —** Publication requires name, stable unique slug, useful description, active primary category, verified Melbourne eligibility, at least one contact route, reviewed content rights and an admin verification timestamp. Store a private enquiry destination separately from public contact details. A gallery is optional; a fallback image is required if none exists.

**BUS 003 —** "Call" uses a valid tel link, website/social links permit HTTPS or HTTP only, and Directions uses validated address/coordinates. External links opened in a new tab shall use safe relationship attributes. The MVP uses a directions link rather than an embedded tracking map. A service business may hide a residential street address and expose only its approved service area; structured data must follow that visibility choice.

**BUS 004 —** Weekly hours support multiple intervals per weekday, overnight closing via an explicit next day flag, closed days, open 24 hours and unknown hours as distinct states. Date specific exceptions override weekly hours. Store wall clock hours in Australia/Melbourne and evaluate with timezone aware dates. An unknown schedule shall not be labelled closed or open. Display an hours accuracy note and correction email action.

**BUS 005 —** Related listings return up to four other published businesses sharing the primary category, preferring the same approved local area with stable ID tie breaking. Do not insert out of boundary businesses to fill slots. Hide the section if no eligible alternatives exist.

**BUS 006 —** Admin workflow: draft → published → archived, with unpublished content returning to draft. Publication is an explicit permission protected action and captures firstPublishedAt. An archived or unpublished listing shall disappear from discovery and forms. Edits increment a version; a stale update receives 409 rather than overwriting another editor's change.

**BUS 007 —** Warn on potential duplicates using normalized name with address or phone. Require a logged override reason to publish a flagged duplicate. Category/local area removal is blocked while active listings reference it; reassign or deactivate through a validated action. Deleting a gallery item shall not remove another listing's shared media.

**BUS 008 —** Local areas have an allowlisted name, unique slug, optional editorial introduction and active flag. They shall be managed as Melbourne subdivisions only; no state/country expansion control exists. Administrators verify eligibility manually against the approved boundary, recording source and date.

Acceptance: publish, edit, archive and restore a listing; validate address privacy, overnight hours, duplicate overrides, stale edits and unpublished URL behavior.

# 7 Ratings reviews and abuse reporting

**REV 001 —** A visitor shall submit a whole number rating from 1–5, display name of 2–80 characters, private email up to 254 characters and plain text review of 20–3000 characters without registering. Require acknowledgement of review guidelines and the privacy notice. Email is collected for moderation contact and is never public. The MVP does not label unverified submissions as verified purchases or verified customers.

**REV 002 —** Validate business publication, field limits, server side Turnstile, honeypot and distributed rate limits before acceptance. Create accepted reviews as pending and return a neutral receipt/reference with "Submitted for moderation". No immediate publication, public edit token, review image upload or public review management page is included.

**REV 003 —** States are pending, approved, rejected and spam. Only approved reviews appear publicly or contribute to totals. An admin can move an approved review to rejected/spam, with reason, audit entry and aggregate/cache update. Store the original submitted text. Any editorial redaction shall preserve a restricted original and a reason; do not change the reviewer's rating to improve a business score.

**REV 004 —** The displayed mean is sum of approved ratings divided by approved count, rounded to one decimal only for display. Sorting uses the unrounded value. A zero count has a null mean. Update count and sum in the same transaction as moderation and reconcile periodically against source rows. Removing or republishing a review shall never increment aggregates twice.

**REV 005 —** Use a normalized private email keyed hash plus business ID to flag repeat submissions within 30 days for admin review, rather than permanently forbid a shared address. A repeated idempotency key returns the original outcome. Duplicate content and suspicious bursts enter moderation, not automatic approval. Staff shall not claim perfect prevention of fake reviews.

**REP 001 —** Visitors may report an approved review or comment with a reason enum, optional details up to 1000 characters and optional private contact email. Apply spam controls and acknowledge without revealing reporter identity. Persist the target and a public content snapshot reference so that reports remain auditable after removal.

**REP 002 —** Abuse reports have open, investigating and resolved states with an outcome and moderator. A report does not automatically remove content. Administrators can hide the target promptly, investigate and record retain/remove/spam decisions. Reports about unpublished or nonexistent targets shall not disclose private content.

Acceptance: pending and rejected reviews shall not leak through detail, search, JSON LD or counts. Repeated moderation requests shall preserve correct totals. Reporters' and reviewers' emails shall be absent from public API responses and cached pages.

# 8 Business enquiries and contact handling

**ENQ 001 —** A published business with an approved enquiry recipient shall have a form containing name 2–80 characters, email up to 254, optional phone up to 30, subject up to 150 and message 20–5000. Require acknowledgement that contact details will be shared with the named business to respond. Do not bundle marketing consent. Attachments are excluded.

**ENQ 002 —** The server shall select the recipient from the listing configuration, never from a visitor supplied destination. A listing without a valid destination shall show available phone/website actions and an email correction route; it shall not accept a form that cannot be routed. General Contact requests use the same pipeline with a configured site recipient and no business target.

**ENQ 003 —** Validate and save the enquiry and an outbound event in one MySQL transaction. Return 202 with a receipt once durably accepted, not a claim that email was delivered. A transactional outbox dispatcher shall enqueue BullMQ jobs; queue downtime must not lose an accepted enquiry. Do not send email synchronously inside the request transaction.

**ENQ 004 —** Delivery states are queued, providerAccepted, delivered when supported, retrying, failed and suppressed. Keep admin handling states new, inProgress and closed separate. Workers shall use stable message IDs, bounded retries with exponential backoff and provider idempotency where supported. A provider timeout may be ambiguous; avoid promising exactly once email delivery and reconcile before manual resend.

**ENQ 005 —** Use a configured verified sender; the visitor email may become Reply To after validation, never the From header. Escape visitor content in HTML and supply a plain text body. Enforce header injection prevention. Provider credentials and recipient addresses shall not appear in browser responses. Optional visitor receipts default off to reduce reflection spam.

**ENQ 006 —** Verify webhook signatures, reject replay beyond the provider's allowed window and deduplicate provider event IDs. Process bounces and complaints into delivery status. A Super Admin can retry a failed delivery with an audit reason; a closed enquiry does not imply delivery succeeded. Before dispatch, recheck recipient and listing availability; suppress and alert the admin if routing is no longer valid.

**ENQ 007 —** Admin views shall show target business, submit time, delivery status, handling status and necessary contact details with restricted permissions. No public enquiry listing, marketing export, lead resale or bulk broadcast is included. Enquiry contents shall be excluded from application logs and analytics.

Acceptance: simulate Redis outage after saving, worker crash, provider 429/5xx, duplicate webhook, removed recipient and retry. Every accepted enquiry shall be traceable to a pending, successful or failed delivery state, with no silent loss.

# 9 Blog and editorial content

**BLOG 001 —** Administrators alone create and manage articles. Each article has title, unique stable slug, excerpt, sanitized rich content, author attribution, primary category, optional tags, cover image, publication date, updated date and SEO fields. Public author identity is separate from admin login identity and email.

**BLOG 002 —** States are draft, scheduled, published and archived. Require title, content, author, active category and valid slug before publish/schedule. Store scheduled timestamps in UTC while the admin selects and sees Australia/Melbourne time with offset. Scheduled publishing runs idempotently with a periodic catch up scan; a missed job shall not leave due posts stranded.

**BLOG 003 —** Draft preview requires an authenticated authorized admin and a short lived preview route, sets noindex and private no-store and excludes draft URLs from sitemaps. A public unauthenticated draft lookup returns 404. Updates to a published article create a revision and invalidate public content; preserve first publication date separately from updatedAt.

**BLOG 004 —** Article pages shall show heading hierarchy, author byline, date, cover, body, optional tags, share links, related articles and approved comments. Provide ordinary share URLs or copy link behavior without third party social widgets. Related articles prefer shared category then tags, exclude self and unpublished content, and return at most four with deterministic tie order.

**BLOG 005 —** Blog index and category/tag pages provide server rendered pagination, 12 articles per page by default, newest published first. A tag with no substantive editorial landing shall be noindex. Do not create empty author archive pages in MVP; author information can appear in an article byline or author card.

**COM 001 —** A visitor may submit name 2–80 characters, private email up to 254 and plain text comment 2–2000 without login. Require privacy/guidelines acknowledgement. All comments start pending; approved, rejected and spam states follow the review moderation rules. Only approved comments appear publicly. The MVP supports a flat comment list; threaded discussions and visitor replies are future scope.

**COM 002 —** Comments may be closed per article. Submission shall recheck publication and commentsEnabled in the API. Reject submissions to archived/draft/closed articles with a safe public error. Sorting is chronological with a stable ID tie break and page size 20. Reporting and removal invalidate comment counts and pages.

Acceptance: prove scheduled publication across daylight saving transitions, private preview isolation, sanitizer protection, accurate dates, disabled comment handling and complete absence of pending comments in public HTML/API.

# 10 Administration and permissions

**ADM 001 —** The initial authenticated role is Super Admin. No public registration endpoint shall exist. Bootstrap the first admin using an operator controlled one time procedure; never ship default credentials. Additional admins are created by an authorized Super Admin and receive a short lived setup link. Prevent disabling or deleting the last active Super Admin.

**AUTH 001 —** Support email/password login, logout, password reset and session revocation. Use Argon2id password hashing with deployment benchmarked parameters, long passwords up to a documented safe bound, generic reset/login responses and progressive throttling. Reset tokens are cryptographically random, stored hashed, single use and expire after 30 minutes. Successful reset revokes prior sessions.

**AUTH 002 —** Use opaque server side sessions with hashed tokens in MySQL and optional Redis lookup caching. Set Secure, HttpOnly, SameSite cookies scoped as narrowly as routing permits. Rotate the session on login and privilege changes. Defaults: 30 minute idle timeout and 12 hour absolute lifetime. Logout revokes the server record, not just the browser cookie. Do not store admin bearer tokens in localStorage.

**AUTH 003 —** Offer optional TOTP two factor enrollment, verification, disable and recovery codes in MVP, consistent with the original brief. Recovery codes are hashed and single use. Enrollment and disable require recent authentication; secrets are encrypted. Whether to require 2FA for every production administrator is a recorded client security policy decision. Lost factor recovery must be verified and audited, never a public bypass.

**RBAC 001 —** Define permissions by resource and action: listings.read/write/publish, taxonomy.manage, reviews.moderate, comments.moderate, reports.manage, enquiries.read/manage, posts.write/publish, media.manage, settings.manage, admins.manage and audit.read. Store roles, permissions and joins; seed one Super Admin role. NestJS guards enforce permissions and object/state constraints for every admin endpoint \[R5\]. Hiding buttons is not authorization. *Amended in 1.1:* the catalogue named here is the MVP baseline, not a closed list; RBAC 002 governs how it is registered and extended, and RBAC 003–012 specify roles, direct administrator permissions, effective-permission calculation, enforcement, caching, audit and the permission-aware interface.

**ADM 002 —** Admin screens shall include dashboard, listings, directory categories/services/local areas, reviews, reports, enquiries, blog posts/categories/tags/authors, comments, media, static pages, SEO/redirects, site settings, account security and audit log. Provide server pagination, search, filters, validation, confirmations for destructive actions and stale edit warnings. Bulk moderation requires per item results and audit records. *Amended in 1.2 by client instruction:* the screen list is extended with the System screens (email logs, activity log, cache manager, queue monitor, scheduled tasks), the Security settings screens (authentication, password policy, login security, session security) and the Website content screens (frequently asked questions, service alerts, testimonials, client/partner logos), each specified in sections 25 and 26 and each subject to RBAC 010.

**ADM 003 —** Dashboard shall show pending moderation, open reports, failed enquiries, due/failed scheduled posts and recent audit activity. Do not expose private text in aggregate dashboard widgets. ~~Keep advanced role editing UI out of MVP~~; the underlying permission model must support future staff roles without rewriting authorization. *Amended in 1.1 by client instruction:* the deferral of role-editing interface is withdrawn. Role, permission-catalogue and administrator-access screens are in scope and are specified by RBAC 010; the permission model requirement is unchanged and is now met by RBAC 003–009.

**RBAC 002 — Permission catalogue.** Permission codes follow `resource.action` in lower snake case (for example `businesses.publish`, `audit_logs.view`). The catalogue is declared in application code and applied to the database by an idempotent, audited synchronisation command; administrators may assign registered permissions but shall never create permission codes through an interface, so an unknown or misspelt code cannot exist to be granted. Each entry carries a stable code, a human-readable label, a description, a module grouping for the interface, an active flag and a system-managed flag. Retiring a permission deactivates it; an inactive permission grants nothing and is not offered for assignment. Every admin capability delivered by any section of this document shall be represented by a catalogue entry, and a newly registered admin resource is visible to no one until a role or a direct assignment grants its permission.

**RBAC 003 — Roles.** A role has a stable identifier, a unique normalised key, a label, a description, an active flag, a protected/system flag and creation, modification and version metadata. Roles hold permissions; an inactive role grants nothing. Protected system roles shall not be deleted, renamed at the key, deactivated or stripped of their protected status. Deleting an unprotected role is permitted only when it holds no administrator assignments, or through an explicit workflow that reassigns them first; authorization history shall survive the deletion of the role it refers to.

**RBAC 004 — Administrator roles and direct permissions.** An administrator may hold any number of roles and, independently, any number of directly assigned permissions. Both assignment records carry the assigning administrator where known, an assignment timestamp and composite uniqueness so a duplicate cannot be created. Direct permissions grant additional access only. This revision defines no explicit deny: absence of a grant is denial. A future deny model shall be introduced only by a deliberate SRS revision and migration, because precedence rules and their support cost have not been requested.

**RBAC 005 — Effective permissions.** The effective permission set of an administrator is the union of the permissions of their active roles and their direct permissions, restricted to active permissions, and is empty unless the administrator's own account is active. Duplicates collapse. An administrator with no role and no direct permission has no administrative access. The calculation lives in one server-side resolver; no other component recreates it.

**RBAC 006 — Enforcement.** Authentication establishes identity; authorization then decides what that identity may do. Every admin route declares its required permissions in code against the typed catalogue, and a route that declares nothing is refused as a programming error. The default is deny. A request is refused with 401 when authentication is missing, invalid, expired or revoked, and with 403 when the identity is valid but the effective permission is absent, an account, role or permission is inactive, or a declared permission is unknown. Error bodies use the standard envelope with the request id and disclose no role-resolution detail. Where access depends on the loaded record, the object-level check is repeated in the service layer, so an identifier in a URL cannot bypass it.

**RBAC 007 — Current principal endpoint.** An authenticated endpoint returns the signed-in administrator's identifier, display name, email, active role summaries, effective permission codes and the session metadata already approved for client use. It returns no password material, no session secret, no unrelated audit detail and not the whole permission graph. This response is the authority the admin interface consumes.

**RBAC 008 — Access administration API.** Versioned, permission-protected admin endpoints shall list and read roles, create, update, activate and deactivate non-system roles, replace a role's permissions, delete an unused non-system role, list the registered permission catalogue, read an administrator's roles, direct permissions and effective permissions, replace an administrator's roles and replace their direct permissions, and read authorization audit events. Assignment endpoints use complete replacement with `expectedVersion`, so a concurrent change is refused with 409 rather than silently merged, and repeating the same replacement is idempotent. Every assignment change and its audit record commit in one transaction. Payloads are validated by explicit allowlisting DTOs; lists are paginated with bounded page sizes.

**RBAC 009 — Caching and revocation.** Effective permissions may be cached in Redis under a key scoped to the administrator and versioned by an authorization version held with the administrator record. Any change to a role's permissions, an administrator's roles or direct permissions, the active state of a role, permission or administrator, or a session revocation shall take effect on the administrator's next request; no revoked access may survive to the expiry of a time-to-live. If the cache is unavailable or returns an unusable value, authorization falls back to the database; a cache failure shall never grant access. Password material, session tokens and other secrets are never part of a cached permission entry.

**RBAC 010 — Permission-aware administration interface.** The admin application consumes the effective permissions calculated by the server and never recreates role resolution. Navigation, routes, records, actions and bulk operations appear only when the corresponding permission is held; while capabilities are loading the interface renders a safe waiting state rather than items that may be withdrawn. Direct navigation to a route the administrator may not use renders an accessible forbidden state, and the underlying API still answers 403. Capabilities refresh after a change affecting the signed-in administrator and are cleared on logout or session invalidation. The interface shall provide a roles list, a role editor with a permission matrix grouped by module, an administrator access editor that distinguishes inherited from direct permissions and shows the source of each effective permission, a read-only permission catalogue with no creation control, and an authorization audit view with filters and bounded pagination. All screens meet the accessibility and responsive obligations of NFR 006/011.

**RBAC 011 — Privileged invariants.** The system shall refuse: removing the protected Super Admin role from, or deactivating, the last active super administrator; deleting, renaming or unprotecting the protected Super Admin role; an administrator changing their own roles or direct permissions; granting a permission the acting administrator does not hold; assigning an unknown or inactive permission or an inactive role; and deleting a role that still has assignments. Refusals are recorded. Bootstrap of the first administrator remains the operator-controlled procedure of ADM 001: credentials come from operator input, are validated and hashed, unsafe defaults are refused, and the procedure is documented together with rotation, removal and a recovery path for a deployment that has lost all administrator access.

**RBAC 012 — Authorization audit.** Every access-control mutation writes an audit event in the same transaction as the change: role created, updated, activated or deactivated; permissions added to or removed from a role; a role assigned to or removed from an administrator; a direct permission granted to or revoked from an administrator; an administrator activated or deactivated; a rejected privileged operation; and the bootstrap of the first super administrator. Each event records the acting administrator, the target, the action, safe before and after summaries, the request id, the timestamp, and the address and user agent already permitted by PRIV 001. Full request bodies, secrets and password material are never stored.

Acceptance: direct API tests cover anonymous access, disabled sessions, missing permission and last admin protection, independent of the Refine UI. For the access-control extension, acceptance additionally requires: effective-permission calculation proven for inherited, multiple-role, direct, duplicate, inactive-role, inactive-permission, inactive-administrator and no-grant cases; 401 without authentication and 403 without permission on every protected route, including a route reached directly rather than through the interface; the privileged invariants of RBAC 011 refused and recorded; assignment changes proven transactional and version-checked under concurrency; cached capabilities proven to be invalidated by each triggering change and proven not to grant access when Redis is unavailable; and interface tests proving navigation, actions and bulk operations follow effective permissions, that an unauthorised route renders the forbidden state, that no unauthorised item is shown while capabilities load, and that logout clears them. Constraint and transaction behaviour is proven against the real MySQL database, not a substitute.

# 11 Media and site configuration

**MED 001 —** Only authorized admins shall upload images. Accept JPEG, PNG and WebP up to 10 MB and 40 megapixels; reject SVG, executable files, animated formats and arbitrary documents in MVP. Validate signature and decoded image, not only filename or browser MIME. Reencode derivatives and strip EXIF including location metadata.

**MED 002 —** Upload flow: request a short lived constrained signed upload → place object in private quarantine → validate completion and checksum → process variants → mark ready. A pending/rejected asset must never be publicly addressable through the published CDN. Use random server generated object keys and least privilege credentials; deny arbitrary key selection and overwrite by clients.

**MED 003 —** Media metadata includes source name, MIME, bytes, width/height, checksum, object key, derivatives, alt text, credit, rights/source note, focal point, processing status, creator and timestamps. Generate responsive thumbnail/card/hero renditions; preserve aspect ratios and provide fallback behavior when processing fails. Content images require useful alt text; decorative backgrounds use empty alternatives in their HTML representation.

**MED 004 —** Gallery order, caption and contextual alt overrides belong to the usage record. A shared asset may be used by multiple businesses/posts. Block deletion of a referenced asset unless usages are removed or replaced first. Remove abandoned quarantine objects after 24 hours and unreferenced ready objects after a 30 day recoverable period. Critical removals must purge CDN content promptly.

**CFG 001 —** Editable site settings include logo, contact email, social URLs, homepage hero image/phrases, featured ordering, default SEO/share image and footer details. City, country and timezone are not general editor settings. Validate settings server side, version edits, record actor and keep secrets in a secret store rather than content settings.

**CFG 002 —** Information pages are of two kinds *(amended in 1.7)*. **System pages** — About, Privacy Policy, Terms of Use and Review Guidelines *(the editable Contact page was withdrawn in 1.6)* — are declared in application code because the product refers to them by address; they cannot be created, renamed or deleted through the interface. **Custom pages** are created by an administrator at an address of their choosing, which shall be validated server side against a strict lower-case pattern, a reserved list covering every route the public site serves and the framework and administration paths, and a uniqueness check; an address is fixed once the page exists, and a change is a new page plus a redirect (SEO 004). Deletion applies to custom pages only, is refused while a page is published, and removes the page's revisions with it. Both kinds use sanitized limited rich content and revisions. Publication is refused for stub or placeholder copy. Never leave sample contact details or placeholder legal text in production. The product owner supplies approved public policy copy. `/contact` remains a public route (UX 003) but is not an editable document: its address, phone number and postal address come from the general settings of CFG 001, so contact routing has exactly one source and validation happens where the address is entered. About is rendered by its own template (ABT 001–006); the other three share the generic reading template.

**CFG 003 —** Categories/services/local areas shall have active status and stable slugs. Category nesting is limited to two levels in MVP; prevent cycles and orphaned primary categories. Deactivation removes a term from new selections while preserving historical links; publication checks prevent active content from relying on an invalid primary classification.

Acceptance: test spoofed MIME, oversized/decompression images, expired upload signatures, attempted key overwrite, missing alt text, deletion of shared assets and a failed image processing job without public leakage.

# 12 SEO indexing and structured data

**SEO 001 —** Indexable pages shall return meaningful server rendered HTML with one primary H1, descriptive title, meta description, absolute canonical URL, correct status, Open Graph and social image metadata. Public URLs use lowercase hyphenated slugs and one configured HTTPS origin. Admin and private content shall never appear in public metadata.

**SEO 002 —** Publish an XML sitemap index split by businesses, editorial content, curated taxonomies and information pages *(the `pages` section added in 1.6; it lists every published page, including administrator-created ones, from 1.7)*, within protocol limits. Include only canonical 200 indexable pages and meaningful last modification timestamps. Exclude drafts, redirects, empty taxonomies, search/filter combinations and private routes. Regenerate/invalidate after publication or removal; robots.txt is crawl guidance, not access control.

**SEO 003 —** Curated category and local area pages require useful unique editorial content and eligible listings. Avoid automated category × area pages. Query based searches/filter combinations use noindex,follow and normalized self canonical URLs rather than canonicalizing unrelated results to a misleading page. Tracking parameters are removed from canonicals. Base listing pagination uses self canonical page URLs with crawlable previous/next links.

**SEO 004 —** Slug changes create a 301 redirect to the new canonical path. Prevent collisions, cycles, cross origin redirects and chains; resolve existing aliases to the latest target. Unpublished/draft resources return 404 publicly, permanently removed resources may return 410 when deliberately designated, and merged businesses redirect only to a true replacement. Do not redirect every missing page to Home.

**SEO 005 —** Output validated JSON LD: Organization and WebSite for the platform, BreadcrumbList where visible, the most accurate LocalBusiness subtype for business details and BlogPosting for articles. Populate address, telephone, URL, geo and hours only when known and publicly displayed. Do not invent coordinates, price range or opening hours \[R6\].

**SEO 006 —** Review and aggregateRating markup shall use only approved, visible, genuine submissions and the same approved aggregate as the page. Omit empty rating data. The technical lead shall verify current Google eligibility rules for directory reviews before enabling review markup; schema validity does not guarantee a rich result \[R7\]. Do not add unsupported search rich result promises.

**SEO 007 —** Sanitize text embedded into JSON LD so content cannot break out into script markup. XML escape sitemap content. An unpublished listing must disappear from schema, related blocks, feeds and sitemaps as well as visible search. On publish/unpublish, invalidate all affected cache layers and confirm the public status.

Acceptance: crawl representative routes with JavaScript disabled; verify metadata, canonical, HTTP status, redirects, sitemap exclusion and structured data consistency. Use schema validation and Google testing tools as supplemental checks, not guarantees of search ranking.

# 13 Data model and relational invariants

**DAT 001 —** Use opaque IDs consistently, UTC millisecond timestamps, utf8mb4 and explicit foreign keys. Public slugs are separate unique fields. Core records have createdAt, updatedAt and integer version; deletable content has archivedAt where needed. Email and sensitive content are not placed in identifiers. Use decimal coordinates and whole integer rating/count fields.

| **Entity**                         | **Principal fields**                                                                                                                     | **Relationships and constraints**                                         |

**DAT 002 —** Email hashes used for abuse detection are keyed hashes, not unsalted hashes. Encrypt recoverable private contact fields using managed keys or equivalent application field encryption. Search indexes shall contain only public approved business/editorial content; normalized private contacts have separate restricted uses.

**DAT 003 —** Restrict deletes of referenced taxonomies and published media. Moderation history shall survive public removal. Hard deletion of private submission data follows the retention workflow; maintain only minimal nonpersonal audit evidence afterward. Do not cascade delete every review simply because a listing is archived.

**DAT 004 —** Index business status with primary category/local area and first publication date; index join foreign keys, review business/status/time, comment post/status/time, post status/publish time, enquiry status/time and outbox pending/time. Unique slug indexes apply even to archived content unless explicitly reclaimed through a reviewed migration. Use query plans and seeded load to validate indexes.

**DAT 005 —** MySQL transactions shall make publication, moderation, aggregate updates and outbox insertion atomic. Workers receive IDs and reload authoritative data. Use optimistic versions for content edits and guarded state transitions for moderation. Concurrent approval/unapproval must not double count. Failed transactions roll back both data and events.

**DAT 006 —** Prisma migrations are version controlled, reviewed and executed by a single deployment job. Use expand then backfill then contract changes across compatible releases. Test schema upgrades and restore on a production like copy with private data anonymized. Production schema push, ad hoc destructive migrations and uncontrolled manual database edits are prohibited.

Acceptance: integration tests exercise unique keys, orphan prevention, exactly one report target, rollback, concurrent edits, aggregates and migration compatibility. Document the final ER diagram generated from the implemented schema as release evidence.

# 15 REST contract and public API

**API 001 —** NestJS owns /api/v1. Publish OpenAPI for every route with schemas, validation bounds, auth requirements, response examples and errors. Generate frontend types from that contract. Use explicit allowlisted DTO fields; never serialize Prisma records directly. Dates use ISO 8601 UTC; local operating hours are separately identified wall clock values.

**API 002 —** Single responses use {data}; collections use {data, meta:{page,pageSize,total,pageCount}}. Errors use {error:{code,message,fields,requestId}}. Use 400 for invalid input, 401 for absent/expired admin auth, 403 for permission denial, 404 for unavailable public resources, 409 for version/state conflicts, 413 for oversized content, 429 with Retry After for limits and 503 for temporary failure. Do not disclose stack traces.

| **Method and path relative to /api/v1** | **Contract and visibility**                                              |

**API 003 —** Public form POSTs require a scoped Idempotency Key, payload fingerprint and 24 hour retention of result references. Return 201 for newly persisted pending reviews/comments/reports and 202 for enquiries. Replays return the original receipt without repeated email or moderation rows. Validate CAPTCHA for a new submission; a valid existing idempotent result may be returned without replaying an expired challenge after matching key/payload scope.

**API 004 —** Cap JSON request bodies at 64 KB for public forms, reject unknown fields and constrain pagination/sort keys. Apply a conservative public GET rate ceiling and cache only safe responses. Form error responses preserve user input in the browser but never echo private text into logs or URLs.

# 16 Admin API and module ownership

All paths below are relative to /api/v1/admin except provider webhooks. Auth endpoints permit only their narrowly defined unauthenticated actions; every resource route requires a valid session and mapped permission.

| **Endpoint family**                                      | **Operations and module owner**                                              |

| /faqs /service-alerts /testimonials /partners            | WebsiteContentModule; typed CRUD with explicit publication actions (sections 26) |

**API 005 —** Updates require expectedVersion in the validated payload, and respond with the next version. The service checks permission, current state and version within the transaction. Published/private transitions are explicit actions rather than unrestricted status fields. Admin lists support documented Refine filters and allowlisted sort fields; private exports are excluded from MVP.

**MOD 001 —** Directory owns business eligibility, hours and search projections. Editorial owns posts and scheduling. Moderation owns decisions but calls the owning review/comment service for transactional effects. Enquiries owns delivery requests; Integrations owns external provider adapters. Media owns asset lifecycle. SEO consumes publication events. Audit receives redacted immutable records. Avoid circular module imports or one controller bypassing another domain's invariants.

**MOD 002 —** Infrastructure adapters include object storage, email, Turnstile, cache, queue and clock. Unit tests replace adapters; integration tests use MySQL/Redis with real constraints. Internal health endpoints expose minimal health to uptime checks and detailed dependency diagnostics only to operators.

Acceptance: OpenAPI, permission tests and Refine behavior shall agree; new unrecognized resource actions deny access by default and cross module failures preserve transaction boundaries.

# 17 Events caching and consistency

**EVT 001 —** Persist domain events in a MySQL outbox in the same transaction as the change. Event fields include ID, type, resource ID, resource version, occurrence time and correlation ID. Event types cover listing/post publication/update/removal, moderation decisions, enquiry accepted, media completed and settings changes. Queue payloads use identifiers rather than private message bodies.

**EVT 002 —** A dispatcher shall retry pending events until enqueue succeeds. Consumers shall deduplicate by event ID/version and tolerate repeat execution \[R8\]. Default job policy is five attempts with exponential backoff and jitter, followed by a visible failed queue state and alert. Retain enough execution metadata for diagnosis without retaining unnecessary personal content. Manual retry is permission protected and audited.

**CACHE 001 —** Explicitly configure Next.js rendering and data cache behavior for the pinned framework version; do not rely on implicit defaults. Public content may use pre rendering and revalidation, while dynamic search is server rendered with bounded short cache entries. Tag/path invalidation APIs must be validated against the selected version \[R9\]. Never cache authenticated previews, admin endpoints or POST responses in a shared cache.

| **Cache**                     | **Default freshness budget**         | **Invalidation rule**                                       |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Listing/article HTML and data | 5 minutes maximum for ordinary edits | Resource version event refreshes detail and related pages   |
| Category/area/home/taxonomy   | 5 minutes                            | Relevant publication, feature or settings events            |
| Search query results          | 30 seconds                           | Namespace/version bump for publication and review changes   |
| Static versioned media        | Up to one year immutable             | New object key for replacements; explicit purge for removal |
| Admin/private submissions     | No shared caching                    | private no-store headers and CDN bypass                     |

**CACHE 002 —** Unpublish, abuse removal and sensitive media removal are urgent: purge affected web/API/CDN entries within 60 seconds. Check current publication state at dynamic detail boundaries until purge is confirmed. Track failed invalidations and retry; a TTL alone is insufficient for sensitive removals. Multi replica deployments shall share invalidation state or receive a broadcast; one pod's local invalidation is not adequate.

**CACHE 003 —** Normalize query keys; include filters, sort, page and publication namespace. Apply cache entry size/TTL limits and request coalescing to reduce stampedes. Approved aggregates are authoritative in MySQL, never only Redis. Separate cache Redis from durable queue Redis in production or enforce compatible durability/no eviction policies and resource isolation.

Acceptance: test worker retry after commit, Redis restart, duplicate events, multiple web replicas and CDN purging. Public pages shall meet the stated freshness bounds, and admin/private responses shall not become reusable CDN hits.

# 18 Security privacy and retention

**SEC 001 —** Apply TLS, restricted trusted origins, CSRF protection for session authenticated mutations, Origin checks, security headers and a tested Content Security Policy. Use parameterized Prisma queries and parameterized raw SQL only. Validate server side, sanitize rich text with an allowlist and escape output by context. Protect against stored XSS in admin previews as well as public pages. Do not fetch arbitrary user URLs server side.

**SEC 002 —** Verify Turnstile server side including expected hostname/action and token outcome \[R10\]. Honeypots and browser checks supplement, not replace, this validation. Default per trusted IP ceilings: login five failed attempts per 15 minutes plus account throttling; review/comment five per 15 minutes and 20 per day; enquiries three per 15 minutes and 10 per day; reports five per hour. Add keyed email/target burst signals without exposing existence. Tune from measured false positives, particularly shared networks.

**SEC 003 —** During CAPTCHA or rate limit infrastructure failure, public writes fail safely with a retry message; do not silently bypass checks. Browsing may degrade to safe cached public content. Do not accept spoofable X Forwarded For from the open internet. A successful challenge never authorizes admin access or publication.

**SEC 004 —** Secrets belong in an environment specific secret manager, never source control, media metadata, logs or browser variables. Encrypt database/backups at rest and sensitive application fields, restrict service identities, rotate credentials and prohibit production personal data in development. Dependency scanning, lockfile review and container scanning are release gates; unresolved critical/high exploitable issues require remediation before launch.

**PRIV 001 —** Publish clear collection/use/retention notices and a privacy contact. Store acknowledgement version and timestamp per form. Collect only necessary data. Provide an admin assisted access/correction/deletion procedure using proportionate identity verification; no public user account is required. The client must approve applicable Australian privacy and content policies before launch; this SRS specifies engineering controls, not legal certification.

| Abuse IP signals / application logs   | 30 / 30 days                               | Rotating hashes for signals; redact log bodies                |
| Security and admin audit events       | 365 days                                   | Minimal redacted action records                               |
| Activity log events                   | 365 days from the event                    | Typed redacted records; scheduled job logs counts, not content (ACT 006) |
| Transactional email delivery records  | 180 days from the last event               | Protected recipient removed at 90 days; no rendered body retained (MAIL 010) |
| Scheduled task execution history      | 30 days from the run                       | Outcomes and durations only (TASK 002)                        |

**PRIV 002 —** Holds require a recorded owner, reason and review date. Expiry jobs shall be testable and logged by counts. Backup retention is defined in section 20; restored systems must replay deletion records before serving users. Policy changes require an updated SRS decision and public notice where appropriate.

# 19 Non functional requirements

The following are measurable engineering acceptance targets for MVP. Test evidence shall record build, environment, dataset, workload, device and date so that a later audit can reproduce the result.

**NFR 011 —** Maintain visible focus, logical tab order, labelled inputs, associated errors, skip links and semantic landmarks. Dialogs trap focus appropriately and restore it when closed. Touch controls target at least 44 × 44 CSS pixels where practicable; never fall below applicable WCAG minimums. Avoid color only indicators, inaccessible star widgets and motion dependent instructions.

**NFR 012 —** Use en AU copy, Australian phone/address formats and Australia/Melbourne display dates. Store instants in UTC and format with daylight saving rules. Display concise recoverable errors; retries must not duplicate forms. Public pages remain readable when analytics, media or suggestion services fail.

**NFR 013 —** Keep module boundaries, migrations, OpenAPI and architecture decisions current. Public page JavaScript shall exclude Refine/Ant Design and backend modules. Establish a bundle budget after the vertical slice; require review for more than 10% regression. Accessibility and performance are ongoing release checks, not a single Lighthouse score claim.

# 20 Deployment backups and monitoring

**OPS 001 —** Provide separate development, staging and production environments with isolated databases, buckets, queues and credentials. Staging shall be access controlled and noindex; use synthetic/anonymized data. Prefer an Australian region for primary data, subject to documented vendor availability and client approval. Record any cross border processing by email, CDN or diagnostics providers.

**OPS 002 —** CI shall install from the frozen pnpm lockfile, lint/type check, test, build immutable images/assets, scan dependencies and apply migrations once. Deploy backend changes backward compatibly before dependent clients. Use readiness checks, rolling replacement, graceful worker shutdown and rollback to the last good build. A destructive database migration has no automatic "undo"; use a reviewed corrective migration or restore procedure.

**OPS 003 —** Expose separate liveness and readiness checks. Graceful shutdown stops new work, finishes or safely releases jobs and closes connections. Set database pool budgets across API/worker replicas. Restrict DB/Redis ports to private networks, enable TLS where supported and apply tested connection/time limits. Run the queue store with persistence and no eviction; the outbox remains the recovery source.

**BACK 001 —** Take encrypted daily database backups and retain continuous/binlog recovery data sufficient for a one hour RPO. Retain daily recovery points 30 days; avoid unapproved long term personal data archives. Enable object versioning or equivalent daily media protection with replication/backup lag at most one hour. Back up configuration and secret recovery procedures through their managed systems, not plaintext copies.

**BACK 002 —** Store backups separately from production service credentials and restrict deletion rights. Test restore before launch and quarterly thereafter. The drill shall restore an isolated environment, verify schema/content/media checksums, replay privacy deletion records, rebuild caches/queues from authoritative rows, disable unintended outbound mail and measure RPO/RTO. Record results and follow up defects.

**MON 001 —** Collect structured redacted logs with request/event IDs, error tracking such as Sentry, uptime checks and metrics for p95 latency, 5xx rate, queue age/failures, moderation backlog, email bounces, DB connections, storage usage and backup age. Do not log passwords, tokens, private form bodies, session cookies or full email addresses.

**MON 002 —** Alert the named operator when public probes fail for three minutes, 5xx exceeds 2% for five minutes, oldest outbound job exceeds five minutes, scheduled publishing is over five minutes late or the latest backup is over 26 hours old. Monitor urgent purge failures immediately. Record on call ownership and escalation channels before launch; dashboards without a responder are insufficient.

**OPS 004 —** Supply deployment, rollback, restore, failed email, content takedown, credential compromise, admin recovery and vendor outage runbooks. Each shall identify owner, trigger, diagnostic steps, containment, recovery checks and incident record. Smoke test browsing, login, a moderated submission and test email routing after deployment.

# 21 Verification and acceptance matrix

**QA 001 —** Use Vitest or Jest for pure logic, NestJS integration tests with real MySQL/Redis constraints, contract tests against OpenAPI and Playwright for public/admin journeys. Use isolated seeds and test email/storage adapters; never submit real reviews or send business emails as a side effect of test runs. Store reproducible reports against the release and requirement IDs.

# 23 Decisions risks and future scope

## Launch decision register

| **ID** | **Decision and baseline**                                                                                             | **Accountable owner and gate**                   |

## Principal risks and controls

Melbourne boundary ambiguity can admit unintended listings; D01 and eligibility checks control it. No account submissions invite impersonation and spam; pre moderation, rate limits, reporting and honest unverified labels reduce the risk. Email delivery depends on a provider; durable outbox, retries and delivery state prevent silent loss. Concurrent edits and moderation can corrupt aggregates; version checks, transactions and reconciliation are mandatory.

Search token behavior may miss short service terms; prefix fallback and seeded query tests must prove it. Cache layers can expose removed content; urgent invalidation needs multi replica/CDN testing. Photography and submitted copy can carry rights concerns; record sources/permissions and provide a takedown route. Backups that have never been restored do not meet the recovery requirement; a timed drill is a release gate.

## Explicit future scope

**FUT 001 —** Business owner accounts, ownership verification/claims, self service submissions, business response threads, visitor accounts, saved listings and personalization are excluded. Introduce a separate identity/ownership design and abuse model if approved later; do not create dormant visitor account tables now.

**FUT 002 —** Paid promotions, subscriptions, payment processing, invoices, coupons, booking, ecommerce, automated lead resale and advertising marketplaces are excluded. Manual featured placements do not imply an entitlement or billing system.

**FUT 003 —** ~~Multiple staff role administration UI~~ (withdrawn in 1.1 by ADM 003 and RBAC 010), public comment threads, review attachments, email verification badges, external search engines, fuzzy/semantic search, map/radius discovery, mobile apps, multilingual support, newsletters and bulk imports/exports require separate approval. *Extended in 1.2:* the following are also excluded, and the modules added in sections 25–26 shall not introduce them: administrator-authored scheduled jobs, cron expressions, shell commands, queue payload editing and arbitrary job creation; raw cache or Redis key access and whole-store flushes; email body retention and unbounded bulk resend sweeps; activity log export; any public account, client portal or API identity behind the client/partner content module; and administrator-editable secrets.

**FUT 004 —** Multi city/multi country capability is explicitly excluded from MVP architecture. Future expansion requires a migration decision covering eligibility, jurisdiction, locale, timezone, URLs, permissions and SEO; preserve stable business IDs and modular location validation to make that migration possible without building the expanded platform now.

## Audit handover checklist

At each release, the technical owner shall retain the approved SRS revision and change history; architecture/version decisions; schema and migration history; OpenAPI specification; permission matrix; content boundary allowlist; license/source records; test and accessibility evidence; dependency/security findings; cache invalidation checks; backup/restore and rollback results; runbooks; monitoring ownership; privacy retention job evidence; and client release acceptance.

An auditor shall be able to select any requirement ID, locate its implementation boundary and test group, inspect release evidence, and identify any approved deviation with owner and expiry. Features excluded in section 23 shall not become implied MVP commitments merely because supporting libraries expose them.
# 25 Operational administration modules

Added at revision 1.2 by client instruction. This section specifies the System & Settings and Security Settings modules. It extends, and does not replace, sections 10, 16, 17 and 18: authentication, authorization, envelopes, versioning, audit, caching and retention obligations already stated there apply to every requirement below.

## Shared settings architecture

**SET 001 — Ownership and separation.** Configuration is divided into four owned groups: security settings, email settings, operational settings and website settings. Each group has one owning server module, one required permission for reading and one for updating, one validation path and its own declared cache consequences. *Amended in 1.4:* separation is by ownership, expressed in the code-declared registry and the owning service, and does not require a table per group. Storage is one settings table keyed by group and key: a group or key the registry does not declare cannot be read or written through the API, every value is validated against its declaration, and no secret is ever stored (SET 004), so the store is typed by code rather than an untyped key-value dumping ground. Existing site settings and general settings (CFG 001) are the website-settings group; their richer validation stays with their owning service while persistence, versioning, audit and invalidation are the shared path.

**SET 002 — Typed setting declaration.** Every dynamic setting is declared in application code with a stable key, a data type, an explicit validation schema, a default value, whether the value is publicly readable or private, whether a change takes effect at runtime or requires a restart, whether the value is sensitive, the permission required to read and to change it, and the cache namespaces its change invalidates. A setting that is not declared cannot be read or written through the API. Administrators shall never create setting keys through an interface.

**SET 003 — Change handling.** A settings update is validated server side against the declared schema and rejected with 400 and field errors on failure; is refused with 403 when the required permission is absent; carries `expectedVersion` and is refused with 409 `STALE_VERSION` on a concurrent change; commits the change, its activity event and its safe before/after summary in one transaction; invalidates the declared cache namespaces; and returns the standard envelope with the next version. Repeating an identical update is idempotent. An update that changes nothing records no activity event.

**SET 004 — Secrets are not settings.** Credentials, API keys, signing secrets and provider tokens — the Resend API key and webhook signing secret included — are held only in environment-managed configuration. They shall never be stored in a settings table, returned by any admin or public endpoint, written to an activity or audit record, rendered in an interface, or included in an error message or log line. Where an interface must show that a credential is configured, it shows presence and, where useful, a non-reversible indicator such as the last four characters of an identifier that is not itself a secret; never the value.

**SET 005 — Bounded by specification.** A setting may narrow a bound stated in this document but shall not widen it beyond the stated maximum without an SRS revision. A setting whose enforcement is not implemented shall not exist: no stored-but-unenforced control may be presented to an operator as an active protection.

## Transactional email provider and delivery records

**MAIL 001 — Provider boundary.** Transactional email is sent through one adapter boundary with an environment-selected provider: Mailpit or an equivalent local catcher in development, an isolated test transport in automated tests, and Resend in staging and production. Application code depends on the boundary, never on a provider client. Changing provider is a configuration and adapter change, not a change to any domain module.

**MAIL 002 — Production configuration validation.** Production start-up fails when the selected provider's required configuration is absent or unsafe: a missing API key, a missing or unverified sender identity, a sender address on a non-approved domain, or a development transport selected outside development. The failure is explicit at start-up, never a silent fallback to a transport that discards mail.

**MAIL 003 — Deliverability obligations.** Before launch the operator shall record, for the approved sending domain: a dedicated sending subdomain where appropriate, published SPF, DKIM signing verified with the provider, a DMARC policy with monitoring and a staged path to enforcement, a valid and monitored From address, defined Reply-To routing, bounce and complaint handling, suppression-list handling, the provider's rate limits, and evidence of successful test messages to at least two independent mailbox providers. No claim of guaranteed inbox placement shall be made in documentation or interface copy; deliverability is a monitored operational property, not a provider guarantee.

**MAIL 004 — Asynchronous dispatch.** No administrator or public request waits on the email provider. The request validates its input, commits the domain change, records the outgoing message transactionally where one is owed, enqueues the delivery job and returns. Delivery runs in the worker. Duplicate delivery is prevented by a stable idempotency key derived from the message identity, a unique internal message identifier, outbox state, a deterministic queue job identifier and the provider message identifier recorded on success. Timeouts, maximum attempts, exponential backoff with jitter, and the classification of transient against permanent failure are bounded and configured, consistent with EVT 002. A permanent failure, a hard bounce and a suppressed recipient are never retried automatically.

**MAIL 005 — Delivery record.** Each outgoing transactional message has one record holding: internal message identifier, provider, provider message identifier, template key and version, message category, the recipient in protected form, a safe subject summary where the category permits one, related entity type and identifier, status, attempt count, and the timestamps for queued, sent, delivered, delayed, failed, bounced, complained and suppressed, together with a safe failure code, the originating request identifier and creation and update timestamps. Recipient addresses are private contact data: they are masked by default in lists and detail views, the unmasked value requires a permission distinct from viewing the log, and every unmasking is recorded as an activity event. Rendered message bodies are not stored. Should a future business requirement need body retention, its encryption, access control, redaction and retention shall be specified by an SRS revision before implementation.

**MAIL 006 — Safe failure reporting.** Provider and transport errors are classified into a bounded set of codes with an operator-readable summary. Raw exception text, stack traces, request or response bodies, headers and credentials shall never be stored in the delivery record or shown in the interface.

**MAIL 007 — Provider event ingestion.** A public webhook endpoint receives provider delivery events. It reads the raw request body where signature verification requires it, verifies the provider signature against the configured signing secret before any other processing, and rejects an invalid or absent signature without disclosing why. It is not authenticated by a browser session or cookie and is exempt from the admin guard chain by explicit declaration rather than by omission. It deduplicates on the provider event identifier, tolerates duplicate and out-of-order delivery, records the event timestamp, updates the delivery record, responds quickly with a minimal body, enqueues any heavier processing, and never returns internal error detail. Supported events include sent, delivered, delivery delayed, failed, bounced, complained and suppressed.

**MAIL 008 — Status precedence.** Delivery status transitions are governed by a precedence rule so that a late or replayed event cannot reverse a more meaningful terminal state. Complained, suppressed and bounced outrank delivered; delivered outranks sent; sent outranks queued. An event that would lower the status updates only its own timestamp and the attempt history.

**MAIL 009 — Manual resend.** An administrator holding the resend permission may resend a single delivery, subject to confirmation and throttling. Resend is refused for a message already delivered, complained about or suppressed unless a separately approved recovery workflow exists. A resend creates a new attempt linked to the original message, uses a new provider message identifier and a new idempotency key, and writes an activity event naming the actor, the original message and the reason where one is captured. Unbounded bulk resend is prohibited; a bulk operation shall act only on an explicit bounded selection, confirm before acting, and report a per item outcome.

**MAIL 010 — Email log interface and retention.** The delivery log is read only: it offers no create, edit or delete action. It provides bounded pagination, filters by status, provider, template, category and date range, search by internal or provider message identifier, status badges, a detail view with the provider event timeline and the safe failure detail, and a link to the related entity where the administrator is permitted to see it. Delivery records are retained for 180 days from the last event, after which the record is purged; the protected recipient value is removed at 90 days.

## Activity log

**ACT 001 — One activity surface.** Administrative and operational activity is presented through one consolidated, permission-protected activity log. It unifies the existing administrative audit and authorization audit records with the new operational events of this section. Consolidation is a read model and an event vocabulary; it shall not weaken or replace the transactional guarantees of RBAC 012 or the existing audit records, and no specialised security record is discarded to achieve it.

**ACT 002 — Event content.** Each activity event records the actor and actor type, a typed event code drawn from a code-declared catalogue, a category, the target type and identifier, a safe human-readable description, safe before and after summaries of what changed, the request identifier, the source address subject to the trusted-proxy rules of SEC 003, the user agent where PRIV 001 permits it, the timestamp and the outcome. Free-text descriptions supplied by a caller are not accepted in place of a typed code.

**ACT 003 — Append only.** Activity events are append only through ordinary application behaviour. No API offers update or deletion of an event. Removal occurs only through the retention job of ACT 006 or a reviewed migration.

**ACT 004 — Redaction.** Secrets, password material, session and reset tokens, CAPTCHA tokens, API keys, authentication headers and full request bodies are never written to an activity event. Private contact data appears only where the requirement that created it permits, and is redacted in list views. Session identifiers shall not be stored on an activity event.

**ACT 005 — Interface and query bounds.** The activity log offers bounded pagination, allowlisted sort fields and filters by actor, event code, category, target type, outcome and date range, with search restricted to non-sensitive identifiers. Indexes support the filter and sort combinations the interface offers. Viewing requires an explicit permission; export is out of scope unless a later SRS revision approves it, with its redaction and approval rules stated.

**ACT 006 — Retention.** Activity events are retained for 365 days consistent with the security and admin audit row of PRIV 001. The retention job is scheduled, testable, and logs the number of records removed rather than their content.

## Security settings

**SECS 001 — Enforced settings only.** Every security setting exposed by the administration interface is enforced by the existing authentication and authorization stack. No second authentication system is created, and no setting is stored without its enforcement. A capability that is not implemented is absent from the interface rather than present and inert.

**SECS 002 — Authentication settings.** The authentication group exposes only settings justified by the delivered architecture: session idle timeout, session absolute lifetime, concurrent session limit per administrator, password reset token lifetime, and, where the client's TOTP policy decision requires it, whether two factor enrolment is mandatory for administrators. Values are bounded by AUTH 001 and AUTH 002: a setting may narrow the 30 minute idle timeout, the 12 hour absolute lifetime or the 30 minute reset token lifetime, and shall not widen any of them beyond the stated default without an SRS revision. Public account settings, alternative login methods and federated identity settings are out of scope; the product has no public accounts.

**SECS 003 — Password policy.** The password policy group exposes minimum length, the documented maximum accepted length, rejection of known-compromised or common passwords where a supported mechanism exists, password history depth where reuse prevention is enabled, and forced password change for an individual administrator. Hashing parameters remain in code and configuration, benchmarked per deployment, and are never editable through an interface. Arbitrary composition rules are not required and are not offered as defaults. A policy change applies at the next password change: existing hashes are not invalidated and existing passwords are not retroactively rejected at rest. The interface and the operator documentation shall state this explicitly.

**SECS 004 — Login security.** The login security group exposes the bounds of per account and per source throttling, the progressive lockout duration, and whether an administrator is notified of failed attempts on their account. Fundamental brute-force protection shall not be disablable from the interface: a setting may make throttling stricter than the SEC 002 ceilings and shall never remove it. Failed attempts are tracked, login and reset responses remain generic so that account existence is not disclosed, suspicious login patterns raise activity events, and trusted-proxy configuration governs the address the system attributes an attempt to, consistent with SEC 003. Account recovery remains the verified, audited procedure of AUTH 001 and ADM 001; no interface setting creates a public bypass.

**SECS 005 — Session security.** An administrator may list their own sessions and revoke one or all others. An administrator holding the session administration permission may list and revoke the sessions of another administrator. The group exposes absolute lifetime, idle lifetime and the concurrent session limit within the bounds of SECS 002. Sessions rotate on login and on privilege change, cookies keep the Secure, HttpOnly and SameSite attributes and the narrow path scope of AUTH 002, CSRF protection is unchanged, and a change to an administrator's access takes effect through the authorization version of RBAC 009. Session listings show a coarse device and browser summary derived from the user agent and shall not claim device identification or fingerprinting.

**SECS 006 — Consequences of a change.** A security setting change that must take effect immediately shall invalidate or rotate the sessions it affects, in the same transaction as the change where the data model permits and through an explicit, audited follow-up action otherwise. The interface states the consequence before the change is confirmed.

**SECS 007 — Recovery path invariant.** The system shall refuse any security setting change that would remove the last secure path for an administrator to regain access. Specifically: administrator login shall not be disablable through a setting; the password reset flow shall not be disablable; a mandatory two factor policy shall not be activated without a verified recovery mechanism; and no combination of settings may leave a deployment with no means of authenticating an administrator. Refusals are recorded as activity events. The operator documentation retains the ADM 001 recovery procedure for a deployment that has lost administrator access.

**SECS 008 — Audit.** Every security setting change writes an activity event with the actor, the setting group, safe before and after summaries, the request identifier and the timestamp, committed with the change. Values that are themselves security-sensitive are recorded as changed rather than by value.

## Cache manager

**CMGR 001 — Purpose and visibility.** The cache manager is an operational view over the registered application caches. It shows Redis availability, the registered cache namespaces with their purpose, approximate entry counts where the cache technology can supply them cheaply, the relevant time-to-live for each namespace, the time and actor of the last invalidation, and an overall health state. Hit and miss metrics are shown only where they are genuinely collected; an estimate shall not be presented as a measurement.

**CMGR 002 — Registered operations only.** The only permitted operations are: invalidate one registered namespace, invalidate one known resource or tag identified from application data, and warm an approved cache where a warming routine exists. The set of namespaces, tags and warming routines is declared in application code. An operation not in the registry cannot be requested.

**CMGR 003 — Safeguards.** Invalidation requires an explicit permission distinct from viewing; a broad invalidation requires confirmation naming what will be cleared; operations are throttled per administrator; every operation writes an activity event with the namespace, the scope and the outcome. Invalidation shall not block the API request path, and shall fail safely and visibly while Redis is unavailable rather than reporting a success it did not achieve.

**CMGR 004 — Prohibited capabilities.** The cache manager shall not offer arbitrary Redis command execution, raw key inspection or editing, raw value display, `FLUSHALL`, `FLUSHDB`, pattern deletion driven by administrator-supplied input, or any access to session, rate-limit, authorization-cache or queue keys. Session, throttle, authorization and queue state are addressed by their own modules under their own permissions and are outside this interface by construction, not by convention. The admin API shall not execute shell commands.

**CMGR 005 — Correctness with replicas.** Invalidation is effective across every web and API replica and the content delivery layer, consistent with CACHE 002; a single process clearing its own memory is not an invalidation. Failed invalidations are recorded and retried.

## Queue monitor

**QMON 001 — Registered queues.** The queue monitor reports, for each queue registered in application code: the queue name and its purpose, the counts of waiting, active, delayed, completed, failed and paused jobs, worker availability, the age of the oldest waiting job, a summary of recent failures, and job progress where the job reports it safely. Data is obtained through the queue library's supported interfaces; raw store internals are not exposed.

**QMON 002 — Redaction of job detail.** Job detail presented to an administrator is redacted by an explicit allowlist of fields. Password reset tokens, session tokens, CAPTCHA tokens, API keys, authentication headers, rendered email bodies and personal data not required for operations shall never be displayed. A payload is summarised for display and shall not be reconstructed into an executable form to render it. A payload whose shape is unrecognised degrades to a safe placeholder rather than being printed raw.

**QMON 003 — Permitted actions.** The permitted actions are: retry an eligible failed job, cancel or remove an eligible waiting or delayed job, pause or resume an approved queue where operational policy allows, and clean completed or failed job metadata within bounded retention rules. Creating a job, editing a payload, and replaying an arbitrary job are prohibited from the interface. Each action requires its own permission, is throttled, requires confirmation where it is destructive or may repeat an external effect, and writes an activity event.

**QMON 004 — Bounded bulk behaviour.** A bulk action operates only on an explicit bounded selection, never on an unfiltered "all failed" sweep. Each item is processed independently and the result reports a per outcome tally, so one item's failure neither hides nor prevents another's result.

**QMON 005 — Multiple workers.** Every reading and action is correct when more than one worker replica is running. Worker availability is derived from a heartbeat or the queue library's own worker information; where a value is a heuristic it is labelled as an estimate in the interface.

## Scheduled tasks

**TASK 001 — Registry in code.** Scheduled tasks are declared in application code. Each entry carries a stable task code, a label, a description, its schedule, its time zone, whether runtime enable and disable is permitted, its timeout, its retry policy and whether manual execution is allowed. The administration interface displays and operates registered tasks only.

**TASK 002 — Operational state.** For each registered task the interface shows the last start, the last completion, the last outcome, the next expected run, the last duration and the current lock state, together with a bounded execution history. Execution history is retained for 30 days and records outcomes and durations, not task output containing personal data.

**TASK 003 — No arbitrary execution.** The interface shall never accept a shell command, program arguments, executable code, a cron expression, a queue name, a job payload or a database query from an administrator. A manual run identifies a registered task by its stable code; an unrecognised code is refused. Task execution is dispatched to the queue and runs in the worker; the admin API shall not execute a task inline in the request or shell out.

**TASK 004 — Single execution and safety.** Each task holds a distributed lock for its execution so that concurrent scheduled runs across replicas, and a manual run overlapping a scheduled run, cannot execute the same task simultaneously unless the registry marks the task explicitly safe to overlap. Tasks are designed to be idempotent and to tolerate a repeat. A missed run policy is declared per task: catch up once, skip to the next occurrence, or run immediately on recovery. A task exceeding its timeout is terminated, recorded as failed and retried according to its policy.

**TASK 005 — Manual run controls.** "Run now" is available only for tasks the registry allows, requires a permission distinct from viewing, requires confirmation naming the task and its effect, is throttled, and writes an activity event recording the actor, the task and the outcome. A high-impact task requires an additional explicit confirmation.

**TASK 006 — Runtime enable and disable.** Where the registry permits it, a task may be enabled or disabled at runtime by an administrator holding the appropriate permission; the change is audited and shown in the interface. A task the registry marks as required for correctness — scheduled publication and retention among them — shall not be disablable through the interface.

## Permissions for the operational modules

**RBAC 013 — Operational permission catalogue.** The permission catalogue of RBAC 002 is extended with typed codes for the modules of sections 25 and 26. Codes remain `resource.action` in lower snake case, are declared in code, are synchronised idempotently, are grouped by module for the interface, and are never created through an interface. Viewing and acting are always separate codes, and unmasking protected data is a code distinct from viewing the record that contains it. No raw permission string appears outside the canonical catalogue. Newly registered resources are visible to no administrator until a role or a direct assignment grants their permission, consistent with RBAC 002.

Acceptance for section 25: settings changes proven validated, permission-checked, version-checked, transactional, audited and cache-invalidating, with an unchanged save recording nothing; secrets proven absent from every settings response, activity record, log line and interface; production start-up proven to fail on missing or unsafe email provider configuration; delivery proven asynchronous, idempotent under duplicate enqueue, and non-retrying for permanent failures and suppressed recipients; webhook signature verification proven to reject an invalid or absent signature, duplicate events proven idempotent, out-of-order events proven unable to reverse a terminal status; recipient masking and the separate unmasking permission proven; manual resend proven refused for delivered, complained and suppressed messages and proven throttled and audited; activity events proven append only, redacted and retention-bounded; every security setting proven enforced, proven bounded by AUTH 001/002 and SEC 002, and proven unable to remove the last recovery path; cache operations proven restricted to registered namespaces and proven unable to reach session, throttle, authorization or queue keys, with `FLUSHALL`, `FLUSHDB` and pattern deletion proven absent; queue job detail proven redacted and payloads proven never reconstructed for display; bulk actions proven bounded with per item outcomes; scheduled tasks proven unable to execute administrator-supplied input, proven single-execution under a lock with concurrent replicas, and proven dispatched to the worker rather than run inline. Constraint and transaction behaviour is proven against the real MySQL database.

# 26 Website content modules

Added at revision 1.2 by client instruction. These are public content modules administered by authorized administrators. All four inherit the public obligations of sections 2, 11, 12, 17 and 19: server rendering, sanitised rich content, published-state filtering enforced in the backend, cache invalidation on publication change, accessibility, responsive layout at 320 pixels, and no sample or invented content in production.

## About page

**ABT 001 — Content ownership.** The About page's title, introductory body, SEO title, meta description and publication state are the administrator's, held in the same information-page record as every other page (CFG 002) with the same revisions and the same publication gate. There shall be no second About content source, and no structured About content stored outside that record without a reviewed schema change recorded here.

**ABT 002 — Template.** `/about` is rendered by a dedicated server-rendered template that composes the administrator's copy with material that must not be retyped by hand: live published counts, the configured contact route, and a factual description of how listings are created, checked, published and corrected. Sections that have nothing true to show are omitted rather than filled. Shipped template copy describes the product as it works; it shall not invent history, people, awards, customers, numbers or endorsements.

**ABT 003 — Statistics.** Any figure shown is counted from published rows at request time. A count that cannot be taken is not a zero: it is omitted, and a genuine zero is omitted too rather than presented as an achievement. Figures use semantic description-list markup and no count-up animation. A failure of the counting endpoint shall remove that section only, never the page.

**ABT 004 — Trust and claims.** The page shall state that businesses do not hold accounts, that administrators create and maintain listings, that Melbourne eligibility is checked, that reviews and comments are moderated, and that published information can be corrected. It shall not claim certification, endorsement, background checking, legal verification or guaranteed accuracy, and shall describe the Melbourne boundary as it is currently enforced, referring to the pending decision D01 rather than pre-empting it.

**ABT 005 — Navigation and indexing.** An About link appears in the main navigation and the footer only while the page is published, following the same publication-aware rule as every other information page; an unpublished page answers 404 and is not indexed, and the published page carries a canonical URL, Open Graph metadata, breadcrumb and `AboutPage` structured data, and a sitemap entry.

**ABT 006 — Media and accessibility.** Photography is licensed material held by the project or the media pipeline, served locally with its required credit and never hot-linked. Decorative imagery carries empty alternative text and no text is embedded in an image. The page meets the accessibility obligations of NFR 006/011: one H1, a logical heading order, semantic lists for sequences, contrast maintained over photography, and a process diagram that remains understandable without its visual styling.


## Frequently asked questions

**FAQ 001 — Model.** A frequently asked question holds a question, a sanitised answer, an optional category or group, a display order, a publication status, optional publish and unpublish timestamps, created, updated and published timestamps, the creating and updating administrators, and a version for optimistic concurrency. Question and answer have documented maximum lengths.

**FAQ 002 — Administration.** Administrators with the appropriate permissions may list, create, update, reorder, publish, unpublish and delete questions. Lists are paginated with bounded page sizes and allowlisted sort fields; updates carry `expectedVersion`; publication is an explicit action rather than a writable status field; every mutation writes an activity event.

**FAQ 003 — Content safety.** Answers accept limited rich content and are sanitised server side by the existing allowlist of SEC 001, on the same path as posts and information pages. Unsafe HTML, scripts, event handlers and unvalidated embedded content are rejected.

**FAQ 004 — Public behaviour.** Published questions are server rendered as an accessible disclosure list or accordion with correct heading structure, keyboard operation and visible focus, meeting NFR 006 and NFR 011. Only published questions within their publication window are readable through the public API or page. When nothing is published the section is omitted cleanly rather than rendering an empty container.

**FAQ 005 — Structured data.** `FAQPage` structured data may be emitted only when the published content genuinely matches the question and answer format and current search engine policy permits the enhancement for the site. The emission is behind an explicit configuration gate, consistent with the treatment of review rich results in SEO 006, and the structured data shall describe only content visible on the page.

## Service alerts

**ALRT 001 — Model.** A service alert holds a title, a concise message, a severity, an optional link consisting of a label and a validated destination, a display start timestamp, a display end timestamp, a publication status, whether it may be dismissed, a display priority, a content version used for dismissal invalidation, audit fields and an optimistic concurrency version. Title and message have documented maximum lengths.

**ALRT 002 — Placement and selection.** Published alerts render above the public site header on every public page. Only alerts that are published and currently within their display window are rendered; selection is evaluated server side. Where more than one alert qualifies, ordering is by severity, then priority, then display order, then creation time, so the selection is deterministic and does not change between requests for the same state. The number of alerts rendered at once is bounded and documented.

**ALRT 003 — Time zone.** Display windows are authored and evaluated in Australia/Melbourne time and stored as instants in UTC, consistent with NFR 012. Daylight saving transitions shall not extend or truncate a window unexpectedly.

**ALRT 004 — Accessibility.** Severity determines the accessible semantics: an informational alert uses a polite status role, and an assertive live announcement is reserved for a genuine emergency. A decorative or unchanged alert shall not be reannounced on every navigation. Dismissal is a real button, reachable and operable by keyboard, with an accessible name that identifies which alert it closes, and focus is managed sensibly after dismissal. Contrast meets WCAG 2.2 AA at every severity, including the emergency treatment. The alert region reserves its space so that its presence does not shift page content unexpectedly, consistent with the CLS target of NFR 001.

**ALRT 005 — Link safety.** A link destination is validated server side at write time. Internal destinations are validated as routes of this site; external destinations are accepted only with an allowlisted scheme, and `javascript:`, `data:`, protocol-relative and otherwise unsafe destinations are rejected on save rather than filtered at render. External links render with safe relationship attributes. Alert content is plain text or sanitised limited markup; script content is never accepted.

**ALRT 006 — Dismissal persistence.** Dismissal is remembered per viewer without requiring an account and is keyed by the alert identifier together with its content version, so that editing an alert's message or severity causes it to reappear for viewers who dismissed the earlier version. Dismissal state is stored client side only, contains no personal data, and its absence — a new browser, cleared storage or a viewer who blocks storage — results in the alert being shown, never in an error.

**ALRT 007 — Administration and cache.** Administrators with the appropriate permissions may list, create, update, publish, unpublish, reorder and delete alerts, with bounded lists, `expectedVersion` on updates, explicit publication actions, confirmation for actions affecting a live alert, and an activity event for every mutation. Because an alert appears on every public page, publication, edit, expiry and removal invalidate the public shell cache promptly within the ordinary freshness bound of CACHE 001, and removal of an alert published in error is treated as urgent under CACHE 002.

## Testimonials

**TSTM 001 — Model.** A testimonial holds the person's display name, their role or relationship to the business, the quoted text, an optional associated directory listing, an optional approved image, the recorded consent and approval state with the approving administrator and the approval timestamp, a display order, a publication status, audit fields and an optimistic concurrency version. The quote has a documented maximum length and is sanitised.

**TSTM 002 — Consent and approval.** ~~A testimonial shall not be published without a recorded approval~~ *(publication gate withdrawn in 1.5 by client instruction)*. A testimonial may record an approval that names the approving administrator, the time, and how consent was obtained; the record is optional and does not gate publication, because testimonials are entered by administrators who take that decision themselves. Recording an approval remains a permission distinct from creating and publishing, and editing the quoted words clears any approval recorded for them, because consent is given for particular words. Attribution shall be honest; the system shall not fabricate testimonials, and placeholder or sample testimonials shall never exist in production, consistent with CFG 002. The residual risk is accepted by the client and recorded in the change log: without a record, the site has no evidence that the person agreed to be quoted.

**TSTM 003 — Media.** An accompanying image is an approved asset from the existing media pipeline of MED 001–004, with alt text appropriate to its use. An unprocessed or rejected asset is never publicly addressable.

**TSTM 004 — Public behaviour.** Only approved and published testimonials appear publicly, filtered in the backend. Presentation uses semantic quotation markup with correct attribution. When none is published, the section is omitted cleanly. Testimonials carry no star rating: the product's ratings are the moderated reviews of section 7, and a second unmoderated rating display would misrepresent them.

**TSTM 005 — Administration.** Administrators with the appropriate permissions may list, create, update, approve, publish, unpublish, reorder and delete testimonials, with bounded lists, `expectedVersion` on updates, explicit approval and publication actions, and an activity event for every mutation including the approval decision.

## Client and partner logos

**PTNR 001 — Scope boundary.** A client or partner record in this module is public marketing content describing an organisation displayed on the website. It is not an account, confers no authentication or authorization, and shall never be extended into an identity, a customer account or an API principal. Business owner accounts remain excluded by FUT 001; introducing them would require a separate identity and abuse design and an SRS revision.

**PTNR 002 — Model.** A record holds the organisation name, a relationship label describing the association, an approved logo asset, accessible alternative text for that logo, an optional validated website URL, a display order, a publication status, a recorded authorisation to display the organisation's mark with the approving administrator and timestamp, audit fields and an optimistic concurrency version.

**PTNR 003 — Rights and media.** The logo is an approved asset from the media pipeline of MED 001–004 with recorded rights or permission where available, consistent with the rights and source obligations of MED 003. Logos shall not be scraped from third party sites, and an organisation's mark shall not be displayed without the organisation's permission. *Amended in 1.5 by client instruction:* recorded authorisation is no longer a publication gate; the authorisation record remains, optional, naming the administrator, the time and how permission was obtained, and is cleared when the logo it covered is replaced. Publication does still require the logo asset itself and its alternative text, because those are what make the strip renderable and readable rather than a matter of permission (MED 003, NFR 006). Alternative text is mandatory and shall identify the organisation.

**PTNR 004 — Link safety.** A website URL is validated server side with an allowlisted scheme and rendered with safe relationship attributes for an external destination, on the same rules as ALRT 005.

**PTNR 005 — Public behaviour and administration.** Only published records appear publicly, filtered in the backend, in the defined display order. The public presentation shall remain deliberate and attractive when nothing is published; an empty strip or a placeholder logo shall not be rendered. Administrators with the appropriate permissions may list, create, update, publish, unpublish, reorder and delete records, with bounded lists, `expectedVersion` on updates, explicit publication actions and an activity event for every mutation.

Acceptance for section 26: unpublished and out-of-window content proven absent from every public page, public API response and sitemap; sanitisation proven on every rich field; publication and removal proven to invalidate the relevant caches within the CACHE 001 bound, and an alert removal proven urgent under CACHE 002; alert selection proven deterministic and proven correct across a daylight saving transition; alert dismissal proven keyboard operable, proven version-aware and proven safe when client storage is unavailable; contrast and live-region semantics proven per severity; FAQ disclosure behaviour proven keyboard operable with correct heading structure; structured data proven to describe only visible content and proven gated; testimonial publication proven impossible without a recorded approval; partner logo publication proven impossible without recorded authorisation and alternative text; empty states proven to omit their sections cleanly; and every list, mutation and publication action proven permission-gated at the API independently of the interface.
