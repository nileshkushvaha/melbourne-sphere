/**
 * Load profile for SRS NFR 003.
 *
 * The requirement is a 30-minute seeded run at 50 GET/s plus 2 form POST/s
 * across 100 browsing sessions, with the error rate below 1% excluding expected
 * 4xx. This script runs that profile against a target of your choosing, and
 * defaults to a short smoke run so it is usable on a developer machine:
 *
 *   node run-load.mjs                          # 60 s smoke at the full rate
 *   node run-load.mjs --duration 1800          # the full 30-minute acceptance run
 *   node run-load.mjs --target https://staging.example --duration 1800
 *
 * Public reads only. Form POSTs are deliberately NOT generated: they are
 * captcha-protected and rate-limited by design, so driving them from a load
 * tool would measure the protection rather than the product. Run the POST leg
 * against a staging environment with test captcha keys, and record it
 * separately in the report.
