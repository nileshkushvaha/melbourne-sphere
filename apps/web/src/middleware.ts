 * deliberately removed page answers 410. Unknown paths fall through so the page
 * itself renders its own 404 — a missing page is never redirected to the home
 * page.
 *
 * Resolutions are cached in memory for a short window so a busy path costs one
 * API call rather than one per request. This map is per process and cannot be
 * purged from anywhere — middleware runs outside the Next data cache — so the
 * window is short enough that switching a redirect off reaches visitors within
 * about ten seconds, which is what the admin screens promise.
