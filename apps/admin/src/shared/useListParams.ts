/**
 * The query, filters, sort and page of a list screen, kept in the address bar.
 *
 * Every list screen had written this by hand — read a parameter, write it back,
 * remember to drop `page` so changing a filter does not land the reader on page
 * four of a shorter result. Ten copies of those four lines is ten chances to
 * forget the last one, and the screens that used local state instead could not
 * be linked to, bookmarked, or returned to with the browser's Back button.
 *
 * The filter keys are declared once, which is also what lets the screen know
 * whether anything is filtered at all — the difference between "nothing here
 * yet" and "nothing matches what you asked for".
 *
 * `E` names parameters that belong in the address bar but do not narrow the
 * result set — sort field and direction. They are readable and writable, but
 * "clear filters" leaves them alone and a sorted-but-unfiltered list is still
 * everything, so it gets the ordinary empty state.
 *
 * How many rows a page holds is here too, for the same reason the page number
 * is: it is part of the view, so it belongs in the address bar and survives a
 * reload, a link and the Back button. It is clamped to the offered sizes, so a
 * hand-typed `?pageSize=5000` cannot ask the API for more than it allows.
