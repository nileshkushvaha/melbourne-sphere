/**
 * Shows a visitor's contact detail only when someone asks for it.
 *
 * The moderation queues displayed every visitor's address as soon as a row was
 * expanded, and the API decrypted all twenty on a page whether or not anyone
 * looked — so reading a queue read everyone's contact details, and nothing
 * recorded that it had happened. SRS ENQ 007 asks for these "with restricted
 * permissions"; a permission that gates the whole screen does not do that.
 *
 * The masked form is enough to tell two visitors apart, which is what a queue
 * needs. Revealing the whole address is a separate permission and a separate
 * request, and the server writes an audit entry for it — the same shape the
 * email log already uses for recipients.
