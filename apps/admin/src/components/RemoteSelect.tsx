 * the API has always accepted and the screens never offered — because offering
 * it naively means fetching every business into a dropdown. This asks the
 * server for the ones matching what has been typed instead, so the control
 * costs one small request rather than the whole table.
 *
 * Typing is debounced: a request per keystroke would send five for "cafe" and
 * race them, and the last to arrive is not reliably the last one typed.
