 * Refine access control (SRS RBAC 010). `can` answers from the effective
 * permission codes the **server** calculated and returned from `/admin/auth/me`;
 * nothing here re-derives roles, and nothing here is a security boundary — every
 * request is enforced again by the API, which answers 403 whatever the interface
 * decided to show.
 *
 * A resource is addressed either by its route path (`{ resource: '/roles' }`) or
 * by a permission code directly (`{ action: 'listings.publish' }`), so a button
 * inside a page can ask about one capability without inventing a resource name.
