/**
 * The frame every signed-out screen uses: sign-in, the verification step,
 * forgotten password, reset and first-time set-up.
 *
 * It is the only page a visitor sees before they are anyone, so it carries the
 * product: a lit navy ground, the form on a frosted-glass card. The styling and
 * its contrast reasoning live in `auth-screen.css`.
 *
 * The form is first in the document. Screen-reader users and the first Tab land
 * on it directly; on a wide screen the brand panel is drawn to its left by the
 * grid, and on a phone the panel shrinks to the brand and one line so the form
 * is on the first screen.
