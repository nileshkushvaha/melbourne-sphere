 * Baseline copy for the pages the product ships with (SRS CFG 002).
 *
 * This is shipped product copy, not placeholder text: every sentence describes
 * how Melbourne Sphere actually works today, so each page is truthful the
 * moment it is published. It is written once, into a page that does not exist
 * yet — the seed never overwrites what an editor has since written — and the
 * client's own approved wording replaces it through the admin editor like any
 * other change.
 *
 * Nothing here states a number, a date, a person or a credential: those are
 * either counted from the data by the page itself or absent by design.
