/**
 * "Open now" filtering (SRS DIR 008).
 *
 * The requirement makes this **conditional**: it ships only when the hours data
 * is good enough and the daylight-saving tests pass, because a filter that
 * silently drops well-run businesses with no published hours is worse than no
 * filter. So there are two parts here: a predicate, and a coverage measure that
 * decides whether the filter is offered at all.
 *
 * The predicate answers the same question as `evaluateHours` — the display
 * authority — but in SQL, so paging and counts stay in the database. They must
 * not drift, which is why `open-now.integration-spec.ts` compares the two over
 * seeded listings covering every case (open, closed, all-day, overnight spill,
 * exception open, exception closed, unknown schedule).
 *
 * Melbourne's wall clock is computed here in TypeScript, with the same
 * Intl-based helpers the evaluator uses, and passed to SQL as plain numbers:
 * the database never has to know about the timezone or its DST transitions.
