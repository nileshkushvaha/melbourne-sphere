 * Builds the CASL ability for an administrator from their effective permission
 * codes (SRS RBAC 006). This is the NestJS-documented CASL pattern implemented
 * first-party: the factory owns the rules, the guard owns the decision, and the
 * resolver owns where the codes come from.
 *
 * **The whole permission code is the CASL action**, on one fixed subject, rather
 * than splitting `resource.action` into subject and action. CASL reserves two
 * words: the action `manage` means *every* action and the subject `all` means
 * *every* subject. Splitting would turn this catalogue's `admins.manage` into
 * `can('manage', 'admins')` — a wildcard granting `admins.access.manage` and any
 * future `admins.*` code as well. A code always contains a dot, so it can never
 * collide with `manage`, and the rules stay exactly as narrow as the catalogue.
 *
 * `createMongoAbility` is used rather than a bare `PureAbility` so a future
 * condition-based rule (an object-level policy on a loaded record) can be added
 * without changing the guard contract. No conditions are declared today, and no
 * Prisma-coupled matcher is introduced (see ADR 0001).
