/**
 * The activity event catalogue (SRS 1.2 ACT 001–002).
 *
 * There is one activity surface, not three: administrative actions,
 * authorization changes and operational events all land in `audit_logs`, and
 * this catalogue is what turns a stored action code into something an operator
 * can filter and read — a category, a human label and an outcome.
 *
 * Codes are `<domain>.<action>` and are declared here by domain rather than one
 * entry per code. That is deliberate: a per-code list of ~80 entries would have
 * to be edited in lockstep with every call site, would drift the first time it
 * was not, and would add nothing over the domain, which is what the interface
 * actually groups and filters by. What matters — that a caller cannot invent an
 * unregistered event — is enforced by `activity-catalogue.spec.ts`, which reads
 * every audit call in the source and fails on a domain that is not declared
 * here.
