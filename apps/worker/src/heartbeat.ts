 * Publishes this worker's liveness (post-audit remediation, SRS MON 001).
 *
 * The audit's F-01 was a worker that exited at start-up and was never missed.
 * A heartbeat makes the difference between "nothing to do" and "nothing
 * running" observable: the key expires on its own, so a dead worker disappears
 * without anything having to notice it first, and each replica writes its own.
 *
 * Nothing sensitive is written — an instance id, a version, timestamps, the
 * queues consumed and two counters. Not the host, not the environment, not one
 * byte of configuration.
